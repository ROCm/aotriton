"""Lease exactly one GPU to each pytest-xdist worker.

Workers of a single pytest run coordinate through POSIX record locks on one shared
file: GPU *n* is represented by the byte range [n*PAGE_SIZE, (n+1)*PAGE_SIZE). A
worker walks the range round-robin and takes the first page it can write-lock; it
holds that lock for its whole session and releases it at teardown.

Three modes, selected by environment:

* ``GPU_LEASE_PIN=<n>`` -- every worker pinned to GPU n, no locking. Checked
  first, so it works with or without xdist. For single-GPU reruns and for
  bisecting a failure onto a known-good device.
* not running under xdist (no ``config.workerinput``) -- GPU 0, no locking.
* otherwise -- lease as described above, one page per worker.

The mapping is deliberately 1:1 worker-to-GPU with no oversubscription knob: running
several tests concurrently on one GPU invites memory pressure and runtime / driver /
firmware / VBIOS races.

    be shown until the run was over, which is the whole point of announcing it.

    ``capsys.disabled()`` is the documented way to suspend capture, but every
    capture fixture is function-scoped while ``gpu_id`` is session-scoped, so
    requesting one here would raise ``ScopeMismatch``. We therefore call the
    capture manager that ``capsys.disabled()`` itself delegates to.

    reorganises it, the lookup below degrades to a plain print rather than
