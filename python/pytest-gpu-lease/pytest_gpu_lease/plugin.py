"""Lease exactly one GPU to each pytest-xdist worker.

Workers of a single pytest run coordinate through POSIX record locks on one shared
file: GPU *n* is represented by the byte range [n*PAGE_SIZE, (n+1)*PAGE_SIZE). A
worker walks the range round-robin and takes the first page it can write-lock; it
holds that lock for its whole session and releases it at teardown.

Three modes, selected by environment:

* ``GPU_LEASE_PIN=<n>`` -- every worker pinned to GPU n, no locking. Checked
  first, so it works with or without xdist. For single-GPU reruns and for
  bisecting a failure onto a known-good device.
* not running under xdist (no ``config.workerinput``) -- GPU 0, no locking.
* otherwise -- lease as described above, one page per worker.

The mapping is deliberately 1:1 worker-to-GPU with no oversubscription knob: running
several tests concurrently on one GPU invites memory pressure and runtime / driver /
firmware / VBIOS races.

    the whole run -- a crashed worker is replaced from its own spec, so the pool
    never resizes and the page it freed stays in range for its replacement.

    ``workerid`` -- the label used in announcements. NOT xdist's ``worker_id``
    fixture: depending on it made ``gpu_id`` unresolvable whenever xdist was not
    loaded (``-p no:xdist``, ``PYTEST_DISABLE_PLUGIN_AUTOLOAD``), including on the

    be shown until the run was over, which is the whole point of announcing it.
