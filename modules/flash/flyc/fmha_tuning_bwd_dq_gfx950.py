"""Traits and tuning policy for the gfx950 backward **dQ (and dB)** kernel.

Split from `fmha_bwd_dq_gfx950.py` for the reason `fmha_tuning_gfx950.py`
gives: the kernel file is about correctness, this one is about speed, and a
number here can only make a build slow, never wrong.

--- What the dQ kernel adds to the forward's traits --------------------------

Three things, and all of them are *build* axes rather than tuning ones:

- `STORE_DB` -- whether the kernel writes `dB = dS`. AOTriton's `bwd_kernel_dq`
  emits `DQ, DB` because `dS` is materialised per (q, k) element only there;
  our gfx1201 port dropped it. A build without it emits no store at all, which
  matters because the store is per element (see the kernel's
  `BwdDbStoreHelper` for why it cannot be a vector store).
- `HDIM_VO_FLOOR` -- the `hdim_vo` counterpart of `HDIM_QK_FLOOR`. This kernel
  reads *two* tiles through the K register path, one whose D axis is the qk
  extent and one whose is the vo extent, so a single floor cannot serve both.
- `LDS_KV_TOTAL_SIZE`, cut to one buffer. `make_bwd_dq_traits` says why; it is
  what makes head_dim 512 fit at all.

--- The geometry is dQ's own, and it is measured -----------------------------

`BwdDqKnobs._with_wave_geometry` replaces the forward's family table rather
than extending it, and the docstring there carries the full
`(num_waves, waves_per_eu)` sweep it came from. The headline is that
`waves_per_eu = 1` is worth up to 4x and the forward's default of 2 is wrong
for this kernel at every rung measured.

The MFMA shape is still not baked in anywhere: `ROWS_PER_WAVE`, `D_CHUNK` and
`K_STEP_QK` all come from `fmha_traits_gfx950`, and `BLOCK_M` is derived as
`num_waves * MFMA_M` rather than chosen -- which is the P7 invariant this phase
had to stop stating in prose.

    makes it usable as a prediction for a geometry that has never been built,
    which is the whole point of computing it in B3.5.

    Let `R` = rows per wave (the MFMA's N extent, since the query row is the N
    axis of both GEMM1 and GEMM3), `d` = head_dim, `n` = BLOCK_N, `W` = 64

    and consumes each immediately, so the scheduler decides how many are alive
    at once. `1` reproduces the measured VGPR count to within 4-30 registers at
    every rung that does not spill (see `test_register_model_matches_measured`),
    so the scheduler is in fact sinking two of the three.

    What the model does **not** include is addressing, the DMA descriptors and
    the loop scalars. Measured residual is 4-12 registers at two waves and
    28-30 at four; it is left out rather than fitted, because a constant chosen
    to make today's numbers work is not a prediction.

    `store_db` adds the dB store's address arithmetic. Measured at +34 (four
    waves) and +70 (two waves) -- itself wave-count-dependent and therefore

        lines, so eight waves cannot each own one.)

        Two things in that table are policy and one is a finding.

        **`waves_per_eu = 1` unconditionally.** It is never worse than 2 and it
        is worth up to 4x -- head_dim 256 at four waves is 675 against 169. The
        addendum's discriminator explains it exactly: the ISA dump for the slow
        build reports 256 VGPRs, **0 AGPRs and 191 spills**, against 460 VGPR +
        204 AGPR and zero spills for the fast one. It was not short of
        registers, it was forbidden from using half of them.

        **Two waves from 128 to 256, four elsewhere.** Four wins below 128 and
        two wins above it, both by margins the table can support. Between the
        neighbouring points the difference is often under 10%, which per the
        lore is not a result a sweep can settle -- those are left where they
        fall rather than tuned.

        **384 and 512 are flat across the entire grid**, which is the finding:
        they are not occupancy-limited and no wave count reaches them. See the
        B3 outcome in `sdpa-bwd-plan-gfx950.md`.
