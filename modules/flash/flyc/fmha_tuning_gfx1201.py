"""Tuning policy for the gfx1201 attention kernel: which knobs, for which shape.

Split out of `flash_attn_func_gfx1201_aiw.py` so that the kernel file is about
correctness and this one is about speed. They change for different reasons and
on different evidence -- a number here moves when a sweep says so, and nothing
here can make the kernel *wrong*, only slow.

**Why a third module rather than folding this into the interface**, which is
where `sdpa-readability.md` asked for it: the kernel needs these values too. It
resolves `k_prefetch_dist=None` and friends into defaults, and the geometry
helpers below are called with values -- `VO_WIDTH`, `BLOCK_N` -- that only
exist part-way through the builder. Moving the policy into the interface, which
already imports the kernel, would be either a circular import or a second copy
of that derivation. A module importing neither is importable by both.

Two kinds of thing live here, and the distinction is worth keeping when
deciding whether a change needs a benchmark or a correctness argument:

- **Policy** -- `default_prefetch_dist`, `qk_shards`, `default_block_m`,
  `default_block_n`, and the tables they read. Measured *choices*. Any of them
  could be changed without making a build incorrect.
- **Geometry** -- `q_tiles_per_block`, `vo_chunks`, `resolve_shards`. These
  compute what is *legal* given a choice, out of LDS capacity and divisibility
  constraints. Changing one can make a build invalid, and they are here only
  because the policy functions call them.

# The old entry (2 shards, 4 q_tiles -> BLOCK_M 64, 8 waves) came from a sweep
# whose note reads "16 waves rejected: reduction buffer over LDS" -- true only
# *with* sharding, since that buffer exists only when QK_SHARDS > 1. Unsharded
# 16 waves was therefore never tried, and it is much better:

# the old config spilled none (241 -> 256 VGPRs). BLOCK_M 64 -> 256 quarters
# the workgroup count and the K/V traffic with it, which outweighs the spills
# by a wide margin -- a reminder that spill count is not a proxy for speed.
#
# 384 and 512 were swept the same way and are already at their optimum
# (384: 61.4/60.9 at (3,4), best alternative 54.2; 512: 52.2/44.6 at (4,2),
# best alternative 36.7). Only 256 was mistuned.
#
# Re-swept in full after gSWA and varlen, both of which moved register
# pressure. Nine of eleven entries were confirmed unchanged. Two were not, and
# **both were mistuned the same way head_dim 256 had been**: a configuration
# rejected on spills or LDS was never retried after the surrounding budget
# changed, so the table kept a choice whose reason had expired.

# runtime extent, so no knob can separate them, and the loss lands where the
# kernel spends sixteen times as long. It recomputes.

#
# The sign of the scratch change predicts the sign of the ratio at every width
# on the ladder, 512 included. Fewer instructions in the loop is what the hoist
# buys; whether that survives the extra live values is decided by the register
# allocator, one width at a time. Re-measure rather than extending this set by
