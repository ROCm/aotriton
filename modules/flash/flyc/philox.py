"""Philox-4x{32,64}-N counter-based PRNG for FlyDSL kernels.

A counter-based PRNG is a pure function of ``(key, counter)`` with no state and
no sequence: every element derives its own random from its own coordinates,
with no ordering between them. That is what a GPU needs, and it is why the
backward pass can regenerate a dropout mask from ``(seed, offset)`` alone
rather than storing it -- a 4K x 4K mask is 268 MB per head.

**This module is deliberately arch-agnostic and layout-agnostic.** It maps
``(seed, offset) -> N randoms`` and nothing else. How a caller assigns offsets
to elements is the caller's business; there are no wave-size assumptions, no
target intrinsics, and no attention-specific code. It is written to the
standard a FlyDSL library needs because that is where it is going.

Using it
--------
Prefer the configured object over the free functions -- it carries the width
and round count together, which is what forward, backward and the mask kernel
must agree on::

    from philox import Philox

    rng = Philox.for_arch()               # measured default for this device
    vals = rng.u32(seed, offset)          # len == rng.randoms_per_offset
    keep = [v > threshold for v in vals]

``randoms_per_offset`` is 4 at width 32 and 8 at width 64, and it belongs in
the caller's offset arithmetic (``n // rng.randoms_per_offset``). The free
functions ``philox_u32`` / ``philox_4x`` remain for callers that already have
a width in hand.

Matches Triton's ``triton.language.random`` bit for bit -- see
``test_philox.py``, which checks against both a CPU reference and Triton
itself. Callers compare dropout against seeded ``torch`` runs, so the stream is
part of the contract, not an implementation detail.

Two widths
----------
``PHILOX_WIDTH`` selects 32- or 64-bit lanes. They are *different PRNGs* and
produce different streams -- as any two PRNGs do -- so the width is part of
whatever contract a caller builds on top:

    width  lanes    randoms per call   state
    32     u32      4 x u32            6 registers
    64     u64      4 x u64 = 8 x u32  12 registers

Which is faster is a property of the target's integer ALU, so it is a
parameter here and a per-arch default in the caller. On gfx1201 the 32-bit
variant needs one ``v_mul_hi_u32`` per high product while the 64-bit one needs
a multi-instruction sequence; see ``kernels/microbench/philox_bench.py``.

Both widths take a **64-bit seed and a 64-bit offset**. That does not require
64-bit arithmetic: at width 32 the seed fills the two key words and the offset
the low two counter words. Splitting a 64-bit value costs nothing -- it lives
in two consecutive 32-bit registers, so the halves are addressable directly.
