"""Flash-attention **backward dQ (and dB)** for gfx950 -- AOTriton's `bwd_kernel_dq`.

B2 and B3 of `sdpa-bwd-plan-gfx950.md`. Dense, non-causal, bf16, the full
`LADDER` from head_dim 32 to 512, with the 8xD input contract, padded heads and
asymmetric `hdim_qk`/`hdim_vo`. The dK/dV half is B1 and lives in its own file;
there is deliberately no fused kernel (plan section 4).

    P  = exp2(qk_scale * S - lse2)        S  = Q.K^T,  qk_scale = sm_scale*log2e
    dP = dO . V^T
    dS = P * (dP - delta)                 delta = rowsum(dO*O), a host argument
    dQ = sum_j dS . K * sm_scale
    dB = dS                               (bias-gradient builds only)

--- The whole design, in one observation --------------------------------------

**Every one of the three GEMMs is a GEMM the forward already emits**, once the
right tensor is staged in the right LDS layout. Nothing below derives a new
lane map, and that is the point: the forward's `V` read path is validated end
to end, and plan section 3 says to reuse it rather than re-derive it.

| this kernel | forward equivalent | A operand (M axis) | B operand (N axis) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `S  = Q.K^T`  | `qk` | K, `load_k` | Q, `ParityQLoader` |
| `dP = dO.V^T` | `qk` | V, `load_k` | dO, same loader |
| `dQ = dS.K`   | `pv` | K^T, `load_v` | dS, packed like P |

The score-shaped accumulators are all `[kv][q]` -- M is the KV token, N is the
query row -- which is exactly the forward's `v_s`, so `seq_pad_mask_if_needed`,
`sub_m`, `exp2` and `cast_p` apply unchanged. `dS` reaches the third GEMM
through `cast_p`, so it carries the *same* K permutation `P` does, which is why
`load_v`'s transpose read lands K in the operand registers the MFMA wants with
no further shuffle.

--- Two LDS tiles, and the read that makes it two ------------------------------

GEMM1 wants K with the KV token on the MFMA's M axis and `d` contracted; GEMM3
wants K with `d` on M and the KV token contracted. Those are the forward's K
path and its V path, and the two stagings differ **only in the line padding**
(`SMEM_K_PAD` 8 elements against `SMEM_V_PAD` 32). B2 answered that by staging
K twice. B3 cannot: three slots is 199 KB at head_dim 512 against a 163840 B
cap, so the double staging is what stops the ladder rather than merely costing
DMA.

So the K tile is staged **once, in the V layout**, and read two ways:

    (V, buf 0) <- K   -> load_v(0)          GEMM3, the stock transpose read
                      -> load_k_packs()     GEMM1, the K path on V-pitch lines
    (K, buf 0) <- V   -> load_k_packs()     GEMM2, the stock K path
    buf 1                unused, and not allocated

`LDS_KV_TOTAL_SIZE` drops to one buffer -- `SMEM_K_TILE_ELEMS +
SMEM_V_TILE_ELEMS`, 133 KB at head_dim 512 -- which is a single trait field
(`BwdDqTraits`, `make_bwd_dq_traits`).

**The K tile is the one in the V region, not the other way round, and that is
deliberate.** One of the two readers has to be re-pointed at the other pitch,
and the K path is a plain `llvm.LoadOp` whose whole addressing is two
expressions; the transpose path is `ds_read_b64_tr_b16` with alias scopes, an
even-VGPR-pair constraint and two open hazards against it (`sdpa_lore_gfx950`).
Leave the fragile one stock. `BwdDqKvLdsToVgprLoader` re-points the other by
scoping two trait fields, so the *formula* is still the shared one.

The alias scopes stay truthful: the K tile is read under `lds_v0` by both of
its readers and the V tile under `lds_k0`, so no scope claims two regions are
disjoint when they are the same memory.

--- Conventions this kernel must not get wrong --------------------------------

Three, and each is a *silent* wrong answer if broken, which is why the tests
check them against our own forward rather than only against torch:

- **`qk_scale = sm_scale * log2e` is applied to the f32 scores, `sm_scale`
  alone to the dQ accumulator at the end.** AOTriton spells them
  `p = exp2(qk_scale*qk - l_i)` and `dq *= sm_scale`. The forward instead folds
  `qk_scale` into Q and rounds the product back to bf16; **this kernel
  deliberately does not**, and `BwdDqSoftmaxHelper.scale_and_sub_lse` has the
  measurement that says why.
- **Neither Q nor `dO` is pre-scaled.** `ParityQLoader.scale_all` is one
  keystroke away and multiplies every gradient by `qk_scale`; nothing checks
  shapes.
- **LSE is read in natural units and converted here.** The forward writes
  `m_row*ln2 + ln(l)`, so `lse2 = lse * log2e` (AOTriton's `l_i = ... *
  RCP_LN2`). `fmha.lse_row_addressing` owns the layout for both LSE and delta.

--- The two head extents are crossed, and that is not a detail ----------------

In the forward, the tensor read through the K register path has the *qk*
extent and the tensor written through the O store has the *vo* one. **Both are
the other way round here**, because GEMM2 reads V through the K path and the
store writes dQ, which is Q-shaped:

- two `BwdDqKvLdsToVgprLoader` instances, one per tile, differing in the LDS
  pitch *and* in which extent their padded-head mask is written against
  (plus `HDIM_VO_FLOOR`, the vo counterpart of `HDIM_QK_FLOOR`);
- `BwdDqStoreHelper`, which rebinds `hdim_vo` to the qk extent.

They coincide in every symmetric build, so only `test_asymmetric_hdim` can tell
the fix from its absence.

--- B3.5: what a 16-row family still needs, after the shape is named -----------

`BwdDqTraits` now names `MFMA_M/N/K` and derives `ACC_ELEMS`,
`SCORE_MSTEPS` and `OPERAND_LANE_ELEMS` from them, and every literal in this
file that meant one of those is now written as one. That change is a no-op
today -- the ISA is byte-identical, same 260 VGPRs at head_dim 128 -- so what
is left is exactly the list below, and nothing else.

**Two findings that do not need the lane-map probe**, both in
`fmha_tuning_bwd_dq_gfx950`:

- `v_mfma_f32_16x16x16_bf16` is **4 passes for 8192 flops** against
  `32x32x16`'s **8 for 32768** (`SISchedule.td`, `SIDPGFX950FullSpeedModel`).
  It is *half rate*, so a family built on it cannot beat the 32-row one
  anywhere the 32-row one fits. `16x16x32` is 4 passes for 16384 -- full rate,
  16 rows.
- `register_demand` says 16 rows takes head_dim 384 from 144 registers over the
  file to **fitting**, and 512 from 336 over to **40 over**. So 16 rows
  finishes 384 and leaves 512 needing one more lever.

**16x16x32 is also structurally the cheaper port**, and that is a third
argument for it: `OPERAND_LANE_ELEMS` stays 8, so `_pack_p_v8_slices`,
`_bf16_trunc_pack_v8` and the v8 shape of every LDS read are unchanged. At
16x16x16 all of them become 4-wide.

What still has to be re-derived, in dependency order:

1. **`SCORE_MSTEPS == 2` is structural, not parametric.** The softmax path is
   written as an explicit `(s_lo, s_hi)` *pair* throughout
   `flash_attn_utils` -- `_score_pair_to_lists`, `_reduce_score_pair`,
   `_sub_score_pair`, `_exp2_score_slice`, `_pack_p_v8_slices`,
   `seq_pad_mask_inplace`. At 16 rows and `BLOCK_N` 64 there are four M steps.
   **`BLOCK_N` 32 keeps the pair, and it is also what closes head_dim 512.**
   `register_demand` at `(16 rows, BLOCK_N 32)` is 404 at head_dim 512 and 308
   at 384, against 552 and 424 at `BLOCK_N` 64 -- so the cheapest port and the
   register fix are the same choice, and there is no need to generalise the
   pair. Settle this before anything else.
2. `_seq_pad_score_threshold` -- the element -> KV column map, derived from the
   32x32 accumulator layout. The KV tail mask and the dB store both read it,
   so they stay consistent for free once it is right. `fmha_mfma16_gfx950`
   gives the replacement: a lane's four accumulator elements are four
   *contiguous* KV tokens at `4 * (lane // 16)`, where at 32 rows they are the
   scattered `8*(i//4) + 4*(lane//32) + (i%4)`.
3. The `permlane32_swap` O store (`_fused_o_128_dwords`): it transposes the
   `[d][q]` accumulator for a 128-bit row-major store, and `permlane32_swap` is
   a 32-lane primitive.
4. `_init_dualwave_q_row`'s `q_row = ... + lane_mod_32`, which the LSE/delta
   row load reads. At 16 rows it is `lane % 16`; the two row inputs stay
   per-lane scalars, because the query row is the accumulator's *n* axis here
   (it is dK/dV, where the query row is *m*, that gets the `dwordx4`).
5. The transpose read for GEMM3. **Answered by the probe, and favourably**
   (`fmha_mfma16_gfx950`): it serves both 16-row shapes from *one* staged tile,
   so the four-LDS-tile risk does not materialise. Better than that for this
   kernel -- **the 16-row maps carry no permutation on the contraction index**,
   where the 32-row one does. GEMM3 currently works because `cast_p`'s pack
   order happens to reproduce the 32-row read's `k` permutation; at 16 rows
   `dS` only has to be in plain order, so that coincidence stops being
   load-bearing.

Items 2-4 live in `flash_attn_utils.py`, which is imported and never edited, so
each becomes an override here.

--- f16 and bf16, and where the operand dtype actually reaches ----------------

Both are supported; `BwdDqKnobs.build_traits` refuses anything else by name,
matching gfx1201's `assert dtype_str in ("f16", "bf16")`.

**The operand dtype reaches only two places**, and knowing that is what makes
f16 cheap here: the `dS` pack that feeds GEMM3's B operand
(`_bf16_trunc_pack_v8`, which already branches on `DTYPE_STR`) and the dQ
store. Everything with an exponent in it -- the score, `lse2`, `delta`, the
softmax, `dP`, the dropout survivor scale, the bias add -- is **f32 in both
builds**. So f16's narrower range (65504 against bf16's fp32 range) is exposed
at those two narrowings and nowhere else.

Two consequences worth stating rather than rediscovering:

- The `lse2` floor and the dropout ordering were both derived under bf16, and
  both carry, for the same reason: they are about f32 intermediates. See
  `BwdDqKernelContext.load_row_scalars`.
- **The dropout survivor scale is applied to the f32 `dP`, not folded into
  `dO`.** B6 chose that on precision grounds -- folding would round `dO`
  through the operand type a second time -- and it is also the f16-safe
  choice, because `1/(1-p)` on an f16 operand is a multiply into a 65504
  ceiling where on f32 it is not.

What is *not* guarded, deliberately and in line with AOTriton and gfx1201: a
`dS` or `dQ` magnitude beyond 65504 saturates in an f16 build where a bf16
build would carry it. That needs inputs far outside anything these tests or a
trained model produce, and clamping it would cost a per-element `min` on the
hot path to change one implausible case into a different wrong answer.

--- Not implemented, deliberately ---------------------------------------------

Causal, windows, varlen, dropout, bias *input*, split-K, paged, `D_STAGES`,
d-axis sharding. `BwdDqKnobs.build_traits` refuses each by name rather than
ignoring it -- every one of them would otherwise build, run and return a
correctly-shaped wrong answer, and `D_STAGES` nearly did: the forward's knob
policy turns it on above head_dim 256 and the inherited GEMM helpers then
reduce over one stage of the head dim while this loop never advances the stage.

--- Tensor argument order is the ABI ------------------------------------------

    q, k, v, b, do, dq, db, lse, delta

Four groups, and the grouping is the mnemonic: the **forward's inputs**
(`q, k, v, b`), then the **backward's input** (`do`), then this kernel's
**outputs**, then the **lower-rank** tensors (`lse`, `delta`, both rank 2).

It is also AOTriton's order -- `bwd_kernel_dq(Q, K, V, B, sm_scale, DO, DQ, DB,
L, D, ...)` and `bwd_kernel_dk_dv(Q, K, V, B, sm_scale, DO, DK, DV, L, D, ...)`
-- so a reader moving between the Triton reference and this file does not have
to re-derive the mapping, and neither does anyone eventually dispatching the
compiled hsaco directly.

`b` sits in the forward-input group even though no build here reads it yet: the
slot is held so adding bias in B6 does not move the wire format. It was
initially placed after `delta`, at the end, which is where an unused argument
naturally lands and is exactly why the grouping is written down rather than
left to accrete.

    **Per element, and that is a correctness decision rather than an
    oversight.** A lane's 16 scores are four runs of four contiguous KV
    columns (`_score_column_runs`), so a 4-wide vector store is available and
    is what the bias *load* uses. It is not available here: a run straddling
    `seqlen_k` would have to be partially written, and a 128-bit store is
    all-or-nothing. Suppressing the whole run instead is exact only when
    `seqlen_k` is a multiple of 4, and silently corrupting the next row of dB
    when it is not is precisely the failure mode this phase is written to
    avoid. So the tail is paid for in full, on a path that is off by default.

    Suppression is by *address*, not by a branch -- pushing the offset past the
    descriptor's `num_records` makes the hardware drop the store -- which is
    the same device `ParityStoreHelper._final_o_global` and `_store_lse_row`
    use.

    It costs 2-5.5x, measured across the ladder, and it is a *cost* rather than
    a ceiling: every rung including 512 builds and is correct with it on. The
    numbers and the register accounting are in the B3 outcome section of
    `sdpa-bwd-plan-gfx950.md`. A vectorised version needs *two* things and not
    one: a runtime second arm for the tile containing `seqlen_k`, and a
    `stride_db_seq_q` divisible by 4, since an 8-byte store off a row pitch of,
    say, 201 elements is 2-byte aligned.

    --- The source is the packed bf16, not the f32 -----------------------------

    **This shortens a live range rather than shrinking a value**, and at the
    top of the ladder that is the difference that matters. `dS` exists twice:
    as 32 f32 scores, and -- after `cast_p` -- as 4 packed `v8` bf16 vectors,
    16 VGPRs against 32. Storing from the f32 list keeps *both* alive across
    the 32-store sequence and its address arithmetic, at exactly the point
    where head_dim 384 and 512 have no registers left. Reading from the packs
    lets the f32 form die at `cast_p`.

    The values are identical: `dB` is a bf16 tensor either way, so the f32 ->
    bf16 rounding happens once regardless -- this only moves *where*. The
    element map is unchanged, because `_pack_p_v8_slices` packs list element
    `pks*8 + j` into lane slot `j` of pack `pks`, in order.
