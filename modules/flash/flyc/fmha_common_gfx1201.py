"""Hardware detail for the gfx1201 (RDNA4) attention kernels.

Two boundaries, and the arch suffix is the important one.

**Not `kernels/common/`**: what is here either encodes an attention ABI
decision or has no meaning outside one. The general-purpose siblings live next
door -- `kernels/common/mem_ops.py` for pointer and global load/store,
`kernels/common/utils.py` for the scalar integer helpers.

**Not shared with gfx950 or gfx1250 either.** `flash_attn_utils.py` is the
gfx950 equivalent and this module deliberately does not import from it or
extend it. The hardware differs enough that the *algorithms* differ: gfx950
schedules around MFMA/VALU co-execution, which RDNA4 has no equivalent of, and
its dualwave traits/context machinery exists to serve that. Merging the two
would mean one abstraction serving two schedules that agree on almost nothing.
When gfx1250 FMHA arrives it gets its own `fmha_common_gfx1250.py` for the
same reason.


Why the branching helpers live here
-----------------------------------

Nothing in this file is AST-rewritten. The rewrite from Python's `if` to
`scf.if` is lexical per `@flyc.kernel` function, so a module-level helper gets
a branch only by building the `scf.IfOp` itself -- which is exactly what
`stage`, `publish`, `publish_transposed`, `write_v8` and `cond_load` do.

That is a feature, not a tax, and it is why those five are free functions
while `Aperture`'s non-branching operations are methods. Two problems
disappear at the module boundary:

**Objects can be held in ordinary variables.** In kernel code an object live
across a dynamic `if` becomes region state, which has to be MLIR-backed:

    fastmath = FastMath(FP_MODE)
    -> TypeError: state variable 'fastmath' is FastMath, not an MLIR Value

Here, `with ir.InsertionPoint(...)` is not a function boundary. An aperture
referenced inside the region is a plain Python local, and the IR values it
holds were materialised before the `IfOp`, so they dominate the region and
need no block arguments. (`flydsl.compiler.protocol`'s carry protocol --
`__get_ir_types__` and friends -- is the other way to solve this, for objects
that must cross a *rewritten* `if`. `MaskedAxis` and `Aperture` implemented it
until the branching helpers moved here; removing it broke no test, so it is
gone. Reach for it again only if kernel code has to method-call one of these
objects under a dynamic `if`.)

**The guarded and unguarded arms stop being duplicated.** A `const_expr` test
in kernel code cannot wrap a single call -- `if const_expr(needs_guard): if
pred: body()` / `else: body()` has to spell `body()` twice -- so every staging
site carried two copies. `_over_batches` writes it once.

One trap remains for kernel-side code. `ast_rewriter._collect_assigned_vars`
counts `name.method(...)` under a dynamic `if` as a use of carried state and
assigns `name` back after the region. If `name` came from an *enclosing*
scope, that makes it a local of the inner function, unbound on any sibling
path that skips the `if` -- a `const_expr` arm, typically:

    UnboundLocalError: cannot access local variable 'qk_cols'

Three ways out, best first: put the code in a module-level function; call a
free function so the base name is a module rather than the object
(`fmha.write_v8(ap, ...)` rather than `ap.write_v8(...)`); or bind a local
alias before the branch, which is what `_check_local_var` recommends in its
own warning.

    an ABI, and rearranging it to delete one four-line helper is a bad trade.

    `block_size` threads cooperate to fill `rows` rows of `width` elements,
    `vec_width` elements per thread per access.

    **`ceil` and not `floor` on the batch count.** Flooring silently drops rows
    whenever rows-per-batch neither reaches `rows` nor divides it: at
    BLOCK_DMODEL 160/192/224 the forward gets 25/21/18, so `rows // that == 1`
    and only 25/21/18 of the 32 KV rows reached LDS. The rest was stale, which
    surfaced as NaN.

    **Two independent reasons for the row guard, and both must be checked.**
    This is the whole reason the function is shared rather than copied:

    1. `nb * rpb != rows` -- the ceil() batches overshoot the tile, so the last
       batch leaves some lanes with no row.
    2. `tpr * rpb != block_size` -- when threads-per-row does not divide the
       workgroup, the leftover threads get `tid // tpr == rpb`, one row *past*
       their batch's share. Those are harmless duplicates of the next batch's
       row except on the *final* batch, where the row is past `rows` and the
       store lands in whatever tile follows.

    Reason 2 is the one that was missing, and it is not hypothetical. Three
    kernels grew a private copy of this function testing only reason 1:

    - the forward is safe, but by coincidence rather than construction. Eight
      of its thirty configs (the non-power-of-two widths 48/80/96/160/192/224/
      384) do have leftover threads, and in every one reason 1 happens to fire
      anyway; in every config where the guard is absent, `tpr` divides the
      workgroup exactly.
    - `bwd_dq` hit it and fixed it locally.
    - `bwd_dkdv` hit it and did **not**: at head_dim 224 its shipped default
      (block_m 16, 4 waves -> tpr 28, rpb 4, nb 4) gives `nb * rpb == rows`
      exactly, so no guard was emitted while 16 of 128 threads wrote one row
      past the tile. Measured 0.90 relative error on dK, silent because the
      store is in bounds for the LDS allocation as a whole, and invisible
      because that kernel's test ladder stopped at 128.

    That is three independent derivations of one fact and two of them wrong,
    which is the argument for one copy.

    """Cut this Q block's visited KV range into `[masked][full][masked]`.

    **Three regions, not two.** A left window kills columns at the *start* of
    the range as well as the end, so masked tiles are a prefix as well as a
    suffix and tile 0 is not automatically live. A negative `window_left` is
    the sharpest case: it pushes the whole band right of the diagonal, so the
    leading masked run can span several tiles rather than clipping one. Do not
    carry the non-causal two-region intuition in here.

    The three are contiguous and non-overlapping *by construction*, because
    they are derived by cutting one visited range rather than intersected as
    three independent intervals. That collapses two of the three special cases
    in `sdpa-gswa-plan.md` section 2.2: a window narrower than a block leaves
    the full region empty, which is detected once and turns the other two into
    a single masked run, and an irregular `seqlen_q` needs no special handling
    because `q_hi` already bounds the rows.

    A column c is live for row i iff `i - window_left <= c <= i + window_right`,
    so over the block the live columns span
    `[start_q - window_left, (q_hi - 1) + window_right]`, and a tile is *fully*
    live iff every one of its columns is live for every row -- worst case the
    largest row on the left and the smallest on the right.

    `alive` is false for a workgroup whose rows all sit past `q_len`, which the
    varlen grid dispatches because its Q extent is sized from `Max_seqlen_q`.
    The kernel is one single-exit trace and cannot return out of those (plan
    section 6.1), so the visited range is *inverted* instead and every region
    count falls to zero. Dropping this makes those workgroups walk real tiles.

    Everything here is i32 and signed, deliberately: `left_col0` and friends
    go negative when the window admits no key at all. See `resolve_window`.

        Recomputed (KV_ADDR_HOIST off) clamps the row first, so `row`
        depends on `ts`, which moves every KV iteration: the 64-bit
        multiply is loop-carried and re-emitted per load per
        iteration. At BLOCK_DMODEL 192 that is 14 `v_mul_lo_u32` and
        21 `v_add_co_u32` in the loop body, against 3 and 11 for the
        pre-64-bit kernel.

        Hoisted selects between two whole offsets instead, so both
        arms are loop-invariant per-lane values and the one uniform
        term is factored out of the select: the loop pays two adds and
        the select, and the multiply leaves it entirely. What it costs
        is one more 64-bit value live per cooperative load, which is
        why this is a knob and not simply the better form -- see
        `_KV_ADDR_HOIST_HEAD_DIMS` in the tuning module for where each
        one wins.

        The hoisted out-of-range arm sends the lane to its own column
        in row `ts`, the tile's first row, rather than to the last row
        of the sequence: any in-bounds address will do, since the
        value is discarded, and this one shares `ts * s_seq` with the
        in-range arm. `col` and not the literal `0`, which is equally
        in bounds and needs no register of its own -- the 0 arm holds
        one value fewer live and still spills *more*, 272 bytes of
        scratch against 44 at BLOCK_DMODEL 192, for 0.863 against
        1.172 on the same baseline. Re-measure before changing it.

        Each form states the bounds predicate its own way, and that is
        deliberate rather than untidy. `row_in_tile < seqlen_k - ts`
        puts the whole uniform half on one side, so it is one compare
        against an SGPR instead of a divergent 64-bit add and compare
        -- but only the hoisted form is free to use it, because the
        recomputed one needs `seq_last - ts` for its clamp anyway and
        because keeping it verbatim is what makes a knob-off build
