"""Tuning policy for the gfx950 parity attention kernel: which knobs, for which shape.

Split from the kernel for the usual reason: the kernel file is about
correctness and this one is about speed. A number here moves when a sweep says
so, and nothing here can make a build *wrong*, only slow.

--- One object, one call (R1) ---------------------------------------------

    knobs = fmha_knobs(arch, **overrides)   # factory -> arch-specific subclass
    cfg   = knobs.resolve(meta)             # fully resolved, ready to build

**Knobs and traits were always the same thing at two points on one axis.**
Knobs are the *partially resolved* form -- `None` means "policy decides" --
and the dualwave traits are the *fully resolved* one. Keeping them as separate
types with a converter between them meant every feature knob was declared
twice and threaded through a function call, which is why `varlen` and
`cross_seqlen` used to travel as keyword arguments *beside* the knob object
instead of inside it.

So `resolve` is a method, and it owns the whole derivation: the ladder, the
padded-head decision, the wave geometry, and the traits the kernel is built
from. `FmhaInputMetadata` stays arch-neutral -- it is *what to compute*, and
no arch has an opinion about it. `FmhaKnobs` is *how*, and is subclassed per
arch.

Two kinds of thing still live here, and the distinction decides whether a
change needs a benchmark or a correctness argument:

- **Policy** -- `LADDER`, the fallbacks, `_with_wave_geometry`. Measured
  choices; any of them could change without making a build incorrect.
- **Geometry** -- `tile_width_for`, `staging_shape`, and the divisibility rules
  `resolve` enforces. These compute what is *legal*, and changing one can make
  a build invalid.

**The ladder is the design, and the granule is a knob within it.** A head_dim
between two rungs is served by compiling the next rung up and passing the real
extent as a runtime argument, which is what `padded_head` records. What decides
the rungs is the *staging granule* -- how many D elements one DMA issue covers
-- and that was long assumed to be 64 because the production kernel is built
that way. It is not a constant: `_with_wave_geometry` picks it per family, and
`staging_shape` states the rule it has to satisfy. Only `PV_MFMA_N` is a real
floor, and it is an instruction limit rather than a staging one.

# Three families. **A** (granule 64, 8 waves) serves 64 and 128; **B/S**
# (4 waves) serve the rest up to 256, with granule 32 where the width is not a
# multiple of 64; **W** stages the D axis (`D_STAGES`) and shards it
# (`VO_SHARDS`) for 384 and 512, on the separate body in `fmha_wide_gfx950.py`.
#
# The break at 384 is not a tuning preference, it is LDS: two KV tiles in
# flight need `2 * BLOCK_N * head_dim * ~8.3 B`, which is 199.5 KB at 384 and
# 266 KB at 512 against a 163840 B cap.
#
# 192 and 256 used to spill in the hundreds and produce non-deterministic NaN.
# Both had the same cause, and it was not register pressure: `_ds_read_tr16_b64_imm`
# emitted the LDS transpose read as inline asm, which `SIInsertWaitcnts` cannot
# see, so no `s_waitcnt lgkmcnt` was inserted before uses. Below 128 nothing read
# the destination before the kernel's own cluster-boundary wait; at 192 the
# allocator starts using AGPRs and places `v_accvgpr_write` copies ahead of that
# wait. Moving to the ROCDL op fixed it -- see the P2 section of
# `sdpa-close-gap-gfx950.md`.
#
# So the register file was not the binding constraint at 192/256 after all.
# It becomes one at 384 and 512, where a wave's Q (128 VGPR) and O (256 VGPR,
# the whole AGPR file) do not leave room for the K/V working set -- which is
# what `VO_SHARDS` answers. See `_with_wave_geometry` for the wave-count
# measurement, which is worth 1.6x on its own.
#
# **32 is a planned rung too, below the built ones**, and it is deliberately
# not in `LADDER_PLANNED`: that list is consulted only after `LADDER` misses,
# so putting 32 there would never be reached -- while putting it in `LADDER`
# would route head_dim <= 32 to a tile that does not exist yet and break a path
# that works today, slowly. It arrives when family S is built; until then
# head_dim <= 32 rounds up to 64 and pays for it (see `_with_wave_geometry`).
# **96 is deliberately absent, and it is a bug rather than a decision.** It is
# the one granule-32 width that computes the wrong answer, and it does so in
# both kernel bodies, so head_dim 65..128 keeps rounding to the 128 tile as it
# always has. What is established about it:
#
#   - Staging is not the cause. `tooling/probe_kv_staging.py` at head_dim 96,
#     granule 32 reports 0/6144 wrong for K, V and Q, on both LDS buffers.
#   - It is not the masking. Enabling `padded_head` at an *exact* width makes a
#     no-op mask, and that output is bit-identical to the unpadded one at 32,
#     64, 128, 160 and 224 -- and differs only at 96, where it happens to be
#     correct.
#   - It is not a scheduling hazard. `waves_per_eu`, `setprio`, `stagger` and
#     `lazy_rescale` all leave it broken with the *identical* error, and the
#     error is deterministic across runs.
#   - It is not the ladder neighbours: every other multiple of 32 from 32 to
#     256 is correct at granule 32, including 192, whose shape is exactly twice
#     96's. 32, 160 and 224 hold across five shapes in both masking modes.
#
# The error is sparse (~9% of elements), scattered in both row and column, and
# appears with a single KV tile, so it is inside one tile's QK/softmax/PV
# rather than an accumulation across them.

        these four numbers plus what they imply, and a constructor that
        hardcodes them cannot host more than one.

        Three families, and the granule is a *choice* in each rather than the
        constant it used to be:

        | family | tile width | waves | BLOCK_M | BLOCK_N | granule |
        |---|---|---|---|---|---|
        | S | <= 32 | 8 | 256 | 128 | 32 |

        | B | > 128 | 4 | 128 | 128 | 64 |

        **A** is measured saturated at head_dim 128 -- 248 of 256 VGPRs, zero
        spills -- so **B** halves the wave count to double the per-lane
        register file. **S** exists because padding a small head into A's
        64-wide tile is expensive, not cheap: at B=4 H=8 N=4096 non-causal,
        head_dim 16/32/48 each take *longer* than head_dim 64 (203/205/215 us
        against 172), doing the full 64-wide MFMA plus the padded-head masking
        on top -- 169 real TFLOPS at head_dim 16 against 801 at 64.

        S keeps A's wave count, BLOCK_M and one-issue-per-wave DMA structure;
        only the granule and BLOCK_N move. BLOCK_N must go to 128 to keep the
        DMA full, since halving the granule doubles the tokens one issue
        covers -- and independently, gfx1201's tuning table reached BLOCK_N 128
        for small head_dim by measurement, on the grounds that a wider KV tile
        amortises the per-tile softmax cost.

        ordering is the whole reason the width is no longer an argument: an
