"""Parity subclasses of the gfx950 dualwave helpers.

`kernels/attention/flash_attn_utils.py` is imported by four production kernels
(`flash_attn_generic`, `flash_attn_gfx950`, `flash_attn_fp8_gfx950`, and the
split-K combine), so it is **imported, never edited**. Everything this port
needs that differs from it lives here as a subclass.

--- What actually differs -------------------------------------------------

Less than the feature list suggests, because the production addressing is a
*special case* of the parity one rather than a different scheme. The dualwave
kernel addresses a flattened BSHD tensor:

    element(token, head, d) = token * stride_q_n + head * HEAD_DIM + d

which is the general BHSD-strided form with two slots pinned:

    element(b, h, s, d) = b * stride_0 + h * stride_1 + s * stride_2 + d
                                              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                              stride_1 == HEAD_DIM, stride_2 == stride_q_n

So generalizing is a **change of variables, not new machinery**. Both `b` and
`h` are workgroup-uniform, so they fold into the buffer descriptor's base
address, which the production code already rebases per batch. What remains
per-access is `s * stride_2 + d`, which is the shape the existing helpers
already compute -- they just have to be handed `stride_2` where they currently
read `stride_q_n`, and a zero head offset where they currently add
`head * HEAD_DIM`.

That is why the overrides below are small and why none of them re-implements a
loop body. Three consequences worth naming, since each removes a whole class of
change:

- **`num_records` still bounds the sequence axis.** Rebasing at
  `(b, h)` and bounding at `seqlen * stride_2` elements makes an out-of-range
  row an out-of-buffer access, which returns zero in hardware rather than
  faulting. The production kernel relies on this for the ragged tail and it
  keeps working unmodified.
- **K and V get independent strides**, which the production code cannot express
  (it has one `stride_kv_n` for both). `load_k` and `load_v` are already
  separate methods that read `self.stride_kv_n_v`, so the subclass swaps the
  attribute and delegates rather than copying either body.
- **The head remap survives.** `q_head_idx = h_kv * gqa_group + group_id` is a
  permutation of head order for locality, not a correctness device. It is kept
  with runtime head counts so a parity build schedules its workgroups exactly
  as the measured baseline does.

# --- the tensor operands are pointers on the wire --------------------------
#
# Every tensor operand of the three gfx950 parity kernels is declared
# `fx.Pointer`, not `fx.Tensor`. This is an ABI requirement, not a style
# choice: an `fx.Tensor` kernarg costs **two** slots -- the pointer, plus a
# packed shape+stride descriptor -- and AOTriton dispatches the compiled hsaco
# by filling the kernarg block itself, from a C++ struct that has a pointer and
# the strides it was already passing separately. The descriptor is 40 bytes of
# kernarg per operand that the caller has no way to fill and the kernel never
# reads.
#
# **It never reads it because every extent is already on the wire.** The
# kernels bound their buffer descriptors with products of `max_seqlen_q/k`,
# `hdim_qk/vo`, the head counts and the fifteen strides -- `seqlen_q * stride_q_seq`
# and so on -- and `batch_size` never appears as an extent at all, only as
# `batch_idx * stride_batch` with `batch_idx` coming from the grid. So the
# shapes in the descriptor duplicate scalars the ABI carries anyway, which is
# what makes dropping them safe rather than merely cheap.
#
# Measured, one build each at bf16 / h=2 / d=64 / s=256, `.kernarg_segment_size`
# from the final ISA, with VGPR counts alongside to show the wrapping is free:
#
#     forward   512 -> 296   (vgpr 164 both)
#     dQ        664 -> 352   (vgpr 190 both)
#     dK/dV     664 -> 352   (vgpr 236 both)
#
# **`Workspace` and `BlockTable` are deliberately still tensors.** Split-K and
# paged are not parity gaps -- the target is `scaled_dot_product_attention`, and
# neither is part of it -- so in every build that ships they are `Constexpr` and
# occupy no kernarg at all. There is nothing to shrink.
#
# The one thing that would have to change first if paged were ever built: the
# block table's consumer is `fx.rocdl.make_buffer_tensor(block_table)` in
# `flash_attn_utils.init_descriptors`, and that genuinely wants a tensor rather
# than an address -- unlike every operand converted here, whose only use of the
# tensor was `fx.get_iter`. A `wire_view` would not serve it, because
# `make_buffer_tensor` reads the layout it is handed. That is a real piece of
# work, not a rename.

    TensorLikeType"* -- so a pointer operand cannot be handed to either

    and `_store_lse_row` uses only `ptrtoint`. The value is verified to survive

    one keeps the `v_cvt_pk_bf16_f32` away from the `v_mfma` that reads *its*
    result as SrcA or SrcB. Same barrier shape and the same reason for it -- a
    bare `_s_nop` creates no data dependence, so only an asm the value flows
    through pins the gap.

    **The hazard, as measured.** In `flyc_bwd_dkdv` at `BLOCK_DMODEL=128`,
    bf16, `CAUSAL_TYPE=0`, `ENABLE_DROPOUT=True`, `PADDED_HEAD=False`,
    `BIAS_TYPE=1` the scheduler emitted

        v_mfma_f32_16x16x32_bf16 v[54:57], v[78:81], v[70:73], v[54:57]

    and `v[54:57]` came out as uninitialised-looking garbage -- NaN and values
    around 1e23 against a correct magnitude of 2e-3 -- in dK head-dim columns
    16..31 and nowhere else. Swapping the `v_cvt_pk_bf16_f32` with the
    `ds_read_b64_tr_b16` above it, which changes nothing but the slot distance
    (the `lgkmcnt(1)` leaves the same DS op outstanding either way), makes the
    kernel correct. That patch was applied to the shipped `.hsaco` by hand and
    five previously-failing shapes came out clean, including the two that had
    been failing hardest.

    **It is a wait-state hazard and not a memory-visibility one.** Forcing
    *every* `s_waitcnt` in the same kernel to `vmcnt(0) lgkmcnt(0)` -- all 131
    of them, again by patching the `.hsaco` -- left the corruption exactly as
    it was, so the LDS data was demonstrably present and the fault is on the
    VGPR side. `s_waitcnt` retires on the scalar pipe, so an already-satisfied
    one between the two supplies no wait state at all.

    **Scope is deliberately narrow.** A blanket "VALU write then MFMA read
    needs two wait states" is not what the hardware does: scanning all 648
    built gfx950 FlyDSL kernels finds ~7500 sites with fewer than two
    vector-pipe instructions in the gap, across 426 kernels that overwhelmingly
    pass. So this guards one shape -- a `_bf16_trunc_pack_v8` result on its way
    into an MFMA operand -- and not the general pattern. The fp16 half of that
    pack goes through it too, for symmetry and because its producer is the same
    class of instruction, though only bf16 has been seen to fail. What separates
    the failing site from the benign majority is not established, and LLVM
    models neither the hazard nor its scope.

    `s_nop 1` is two wait states. One runs per eight-element pack, against the
    128 MFMAs in the same loop iteration.

def exp2_wait_state(values):
    """One wait state between a batch of `exp2` results and their consumers.

    `v_exp_f32` is a quarter-rate transcendental -- it retires 16 lanes a cycle
    -- so a VALU instruction issued in the very next slot reads a destination
    the trans unit has only partly written. CDNA requires one wait state there
    and `GCNHazardRecognizer` does not model it for gfx950, so the schedule is
    free to emit `v_exp_f32 vN, ..` immediately before the
    `v_cvt_pk_bf16_f32 vM, v(N-1), vN` of `_bf16_trunc_pack_v8`. When it does,
    that element of the eight-wide B operand carries the *pre-exp* score into
    the MFMA, which is why the symptom is a single wrong element rather than a
    wrong tile.

    **`_s_nop` alone does not fix this, and the earlier claim that it did was
    wrong.** `s_nop` is side-effecting inline asm with no operands, so it
    orders itself against memory but creates no data dependence on the values;
    LLVM moves pure VALU across it freely. Measured on the shipped kernels: of
    the eight dK/dV builds scanned, the `_s_nop(1)` stayed adjacent to an
    `exp2` in exactly one, and the two zero-gap sites in
    `BLOCK_DMODEL=192, PADDED_HEAD=False` survived it.

    So the barrier has to be one the value flows *through*. Every input is tied
    to the matching output (`"0"`, `"1"`, ... constraints), which forces the
    allocator to give each pair one register: the asm costs no moves, emits the
    single `s_nop 0` that supplies the wait state, and no consumer can be
    hoisted above it because it reads the asm's result and not the `exp2`'s.
    Only the last `exp2` in the batch is actually at risk -- the others have
    the rest of the batch between them and the barrier -- so one barrier covers
    the whole list.

    **`has_side_effects` is deliberately off, and it is the difference between
    free and a 48% regression.** A side-effecting asm is a scheduling-region
    boundary, and rung 224 sits on the 512-VGPR cliff already spilling: adding
    one there took `vgpr_spill_count` from 100 to 440 and cost 38-48% of the
    backward at head_dim 216, `causal=False`. Dropping the flag restores the
    pre-fix allocation *exactly* -- spill 100 and 468 scratch bytes at
    `PADDED_HEAD=True`, 80 and 68 at `False`, both identical to the build
    without this call -- and the ordering does not depend on the flag anyway:
    what holds a consumer below the `s_nop` is the SSA def-use edge through the
    tied operand, which no pass can break. Four other shapes were measured and
    rejected -- side-effecting at widths 16, 8, 4 and 1 all spill 438-440, and
    a `sched_barrier(0)`/`s_nop`/`sched_barrier(0)` sandwich spills 296.

    `s_nop 0` is one wait state, which is what the hazard asks for. It runs
    once per score sub-block, against 128 MFMAs in the same loop iteration.

    """Byte bound for a `(q_row, kv_col)` bias slab, in `num_records` terms.

    `stride_b_seq_q` is the distance between bias rows, **not** the width of
    one. They coincide only when the bias is contiguous in `(.., seqlen_q,
    seqlen_k)` order; a BSHD caller hands us `(batch, seqlen_q, head,
    seqlen_k)`, where the row stride is `num_heads * seqlen_k` and each row's
    real extent is `seqlen_k` -- the rest of the stride belongs to the *other
    heads* of that row.

    So `seqlen_q * stride_b_seq_q`, the obvious bound, overshoots the slab by
    `stride_b_seq_q - seqlen_k`. For an interior head that merely reads a
    neighbouring head's bias into columns the KV tail mask then sets to `-inf`,
    which is invisible. For the **last** (batch, head) slab it runs off the end
    of the tensor, and if the allocation happens to end a mapping there it is a
    hard memory fault rather than a clamped read: `flyc_attn_fwd` faulting on
    the first byte past a `(3, 5, 32, 16)` bias with strides
    `(2560, 16, 80, 1)`, 128 bytes past, is exactly this.

    The true end of the slab is the last row's last column, so the bound is
    `(seqlen_q - 1) * stride_b_seq_q + seqlen_k`. That subtraction wraps when
    `seqlen_q` is 0 -- a varlen empty sequence -- and an index that wraps
    becomes a `num_records` covering all of memory, which is the failure this
    is fixing rather than a smaller version of it. `minui` against the
    untightened span pins that case back to 0 and is a no-op everywhere else,
    since `seqlen_k <= stride_b_seq_q` always holds.

    **Do not round this up, and do not widen it back to `loose`.** Ending on
    the last valid element costs the *readers* something: gfx950 range-checks a
    multi-dword buffer op per dword and drops any dword not wholly inside
    `num_records`, so for odd `seqlen_k` a wide read of the last row loses
    column `seqlen_k-1` to the out-of-range column `seqlen_k` sharing its
    dword. That is a load-side problem and `ParitySoftmaxHelper._add_bias_
    inplace` solves it load-side, with 2-byte reads on the tiles that can hold
    that column. Buying those columns back here instead would mean reading
    memory the caller never handed us -- 2 bytes for a rounded-up bound, up to
    `(stride_b_seq_q - seqlen_k) * elem_bytes` for `loose`, which is the fault
    described above.

    `_bias_slab_num_records_bytes`'s problem, on the Q/K/V/O/DO/DK/DV slabs,
    with the same answer: `stride_seq` is the distance between rows, `hdim` is
    the width of one, and the two coincide only when the tensor is contiguous
    in `(.., seqlen, hdim)` order. A BSHD caller hands us
    `(batch, seqlen, head, hdim)`, where the row stride is `num_heads * hdim`
    and the rest of it belongs to the *other heads* of that row -- so the
    obvious `rows * stride_seq` overshoots the slab by `stride_seq - hdim`.

    For an interior head that overshoot reads a neighbouring head's rows, which
    `PADDED_HEAD`'s `discard` throws away regardless. For the **last** (batch,
    head) slab it runs off the end of the tensor. Concretely, a `(3, 5, 64, 8)`
    Q at strides `(2560, 8, 40, 1)`: the slab at `(batch 2, head 4)` is based
    at element 5152 and bounded at 5152 + 64*40 = 7712, while the tensor ends
    at 7680. `BLOCK_DMODEL` is 32 for `hdim_qk` 8, so `ParityQLoader` issues
    the last row's load out to column 31 -- 24 elements past the allocation,
    with the hardware range check permitting every one of them because they are
    inside a `num_records` that should never have covered them. Whether that
    faults is up to the page mapping, which is why it surfaced as intermittent
    `pytest-xdist` worker deaths on the padded head dims rather than as a
    reproducible failure. Ending on the last row's last real element clamps
    exactly those accesses, and clamped is what they always assumed they were.

    **Under BHSD this changes nothing, by construction.** There
    `stride_seq == hdim`, so `(rows - 1) * stride_seq + hdim` *is*
    `rows * stride_seq` -- the same descriptor, down to the
    `oob_off == num_records` equality the D-tail store suppression relies on.
    Elsewhere the bound only shrinks, so an `oob_off` of `rows * stride_seq`
    stays at or past it and keeps being dropped.

    **Do not round `hdim` up to the load's 8-element chunk.** That would buy
    back the column a wide read loses to gfx950's per-dword range check at an
    odd `hdim`, and it would buy it by reading memory the caller never handed
    us -- the fault above, in miniature. The chunk containing `hdim` is
    allocation slack for a BSHD interior head and is off the end of the tensor
    for the last one.

    The subtraction wraps at `rows == 0` -- a varlen empty sequence -- and an
    index that wraps becomes a `num_records` covering all of memory, which is a
    bigger version of this bug rather than a smaller one. The `rows > 0` select
    pins that case back to the untightened 0.

    wave per d-band, `line = wave + d * SMEM_N_RPT`, which is correct exactly

        The base class knows exactly one varlen shape -- cumulative
        `cu_seqlens` on both sides -- and reads it directly. `VarlenBits`
        generalizes that to three orthogonal axes per side (STACKED, LENGTH,
        POSITION), which is five useful configurations rather than one, so the
        decode replaces that branch rather than extending it.

        `fmha.decode_addressing` is gfx1201's, reused unedited: the bits mean
        the same thing on both architectures, and a second copy of a wire
        format is a second thing to keep in step.

        **Unconditional, and dense is not a separate case.** `varlen_bits == 0`
        decodes to BHSD / MAX / IMPLIED, for which `decode_addressing` returns
        `(max_seqlen, 0, z)` -- which is dense addressing, spelled once. Every
        array read inside it is branched over rather than selected, so the null
        `seqinfo` pointers a dense call passes are never dereferenced and the
        bits-zero path costs a not-taken scalar branch. Compiling the decode
        away for dense would buy that branch back and cost a second binary,
        which is the trade gfx1201 already declined.

        Four things about the shape of this:

        - **`z` is not `batch_idx`.** The workgroup's `z` selects a *sequence*;
          the decode says which *batch slice* that sequence lives in, which is
          `z` for a batched layout and 0 for a packed one. Overwriting
          `batch_idx` here is what keeps `_slab_byte_base` correct without a
          varlen branch inside it.
        - **`z` outlives that overwrite**, as `seq_idx_i32`. Anything indexed by
          *sequence* rather than by batch slice needs it, and after this method
          runs there is nowhere else to get it: `init_philox` is the caller that
          found this out the hard way.
        - **The reads are scalar.** `z` is workgroup-uniform, so these land in
          SGPRs and cost nothing against the VGPR budget.
        - **Row offsets stay separate from the batch index.** A packed tensor
          has `batch = 0` and a large `row_off`; a padded one has a real batch
          and `row_off = 0`. Both go through the same
          `batch * s_batch + row_off * s_seq`, which is why the descriptors
          need no varlen case at all.

        dropout mask is generated here and *regenerated* by the backward pass
        and by the debug mask kernel; all three must agree bit for bit or the
        gradients are quietly wrong. They agree because they call the same two
        functions, not because three transcriptions of one formula happened to
        match.

        The consequence to write down, since it is invisible in any test run at
        a single tile size: **the mask is a function of element coordinates
        only.** `grid_plane` is given `max_seqlen_q`/`max_seqlen_k`, never
        `BLOCK_M`/`BLOCK_N`, so re-tuning the tile geometry cannot move a single
        random. From this phase onward that is a constraint on the tuner, not
        just a property of today's code.

        **The plane is indexed by the grid's sequence, not by `batch_idx`.**
        Those two differ exactly when they matter: `init_sequence_lengths`
        resolves `batch_idx` to the *batch slice* a sequence lives in, and a
        stacked layout puts every sequence in slice 0. Reading it here would
        give a whole packed batch one plane, so N sequences would draw the same

        **After the scale and before the mask**, and both halves of that matter:

        - after, because `m_i` and the exponent live in the base-2 scaled
          domain -- Q is pre-scaled by `sm_scale * log2e` on this kernel -- so
          a bias in natural units has to cross into it. This is AOTriton's
          `qk += bias * 1.44269504089`.
        - before, because a column past `seqlen_k` must stay `-inf` rather than
          becoming `-inf + bias`. Those columns are not keys the caller hid;
          they do not exist, and neither do their bias entries.

        No runtime "does this tile need it" guard. There is nothing to skip: a
        bias build reads a bias for every live tile by definition.

        `narrow_tail` reads the run one column at a time instead of as one
        `dwordx2`/`dwordx4`. gfx950 range-checks a multi-dword buffer op **per
        dword** and drops any dword that is not wholly inside `num_records`, so
        a live column paired into the same dword as an out-of-range one is
        dropped with it. `_bias_slab_num_records_bytes` ends the slab exactly on
        the last valid element, so for odd `seqlen_k` the final dword covers
        columns `(seqlen_k-1, seqlen_k)` and straddles: the last row's last bias
        entry reads back 0, for every `(batch, head)`. Widening the bound would
        make the kernel read memory the caller never handed it, so the load
        narrows instead.

        Only the tiles that can *contain* column `seqlen_k-1` need it. A
        straddle requires `seqlen_k` odd, hence `seqlen_k % BLOCK_N != 0`, hence
        that tile is partial and takes the KV tail mask -- so
        `seq_pad_mask_if_needed` passes `narrow_tail`, and `bias_to_lists` does
        not. An interior tile is wholly in bounds, so its final dword covers
        `(c, c+1)` with `c+1 <= seqlen_k-1` and ends at or before the bound; it
        keeps the wide load.

        no-op -- but measured 197 us against causal's 126 at an unbounded left
        bound, because it forces the mask onto every interior tile in the walk.

        Each term is the worst case over the tile:

        - a column can overrun the right bound only if the *lowest* row's
          bound, `q_start + right`, lands inside the tile;
        - a column can fall behind the left bound only if the *highest* row's
          edge, `q_start + BLOCK_M - 1 - left`, is still above `kv_start`.

        LSE is an **optional** output. `attn_fwd_params::L` is declared "Can be
        `T2::get_null_tensor()`" (include/aotriton/flash.h), and an inference
        caller that will never run a backward passes exactly that. The Triton
        kernel spells the contract as `L_not_null` -- *"Allows null L for
        training=False"*, modules/flash/kernel/fwd_kernel.py -- and gfx1201's
        FlyDSL kernel spells it as `_l_valid`

        `L` reached `_make_ws_rsrc` as a descriptor based at address 0 and the
        store faulted.

        So the optionality is a **runtime** property, not a build-time one.
        `RETURN_LSE` is a compile-time knob that deletes the store outright,
        which is the wrong instrument for it twice over: one AOT binary has to
        serve both kinds of caller, and a build with the store deleted is not
        "LSE optional", it is "LSE never written". `RETURN_LSE` therefore stays
        pinned on for AOT (modules/flash/aot/flyc_attn_fwd.py) and the null
        case is decided here, per launch.

        The condition is wave-uniform, so this is a scalar branch. Everything
        the store needs -- the log, the scale, the addressing -- stays inside
        it, for the reason gfx1201's kernel records at its own guard: hoisting
        that arithmetic out cost 8% at head_dim 256 even with the store still
        predicated, because the values then stay live across the epilogue for
        every wave, including the ones with nothing to store.

        LSE is always **compact** -- it is the one tensor whose strides are not
        a free variable but a function of the bits, the head count and the
        token count, which is why no `lse_stride` is passed (plan section 4.2).
        Compact is not the same as fixed, though, and the production formula
        `q_head_idx * seq_len_v + q_row` pins all three of the things that
        vary:

        - **the token pitch.** `seq_len_v` is `max_seqlen_q`, which is right
          for a batched layout that pads every row-group to the longest
          sequence. A stacked Q side runs to the *batch total* instead, which
          is what `lse_token_pitch` decoded into `lse_tokens_i32`.
        - **the row origin.** A packed sequence starts at `q_row_off`, not 0.
        - **the layout.** Bits 17:16 choose `_HT` -- `(H, T)`, T contiguous,
          AOTriton's -- or `_TH`, which is Transformer Engine's. The production
          formula is `_HT` written out, so `_TH` was silently ignored.

        `fmha.lse_row_addressing` is gfx1201's and returns `(base, pitch)` so
        the per-row part stays a multiply-add. It is called with **batch 0**
        because the descriptor below already folds the batch in, and the two
        must not both count it; that works for either layout because a batch's
        rows are contiguous in both, `H * tokens` of them.

        The production row expression `q_head_idx * seq_len_v + q_row` is not a
        second case to keep: it is what this form *is* at `varlen_bits == 0`,
        `row_off == 0` and `tokens == seq_len_v`. One term in the descriptor is
        **not** the production one, though: the head count.

        Upstream's `_store_lse_row` sizes the per-batch slice with
        `traits.NUM_HEADS_Q`, a compile-time trait, because upstream compiles a
        kernel per shape. AOT cannot: one binary serves every head count, so
        `modules/flash/aot/flyc_attn_fwd.py` pins `num_heads=1` and the real
        count arrives as the `num_head_q` kernarg. With the trait, the
        descriptor covers `1 * tokens` rows, the batch stride advances by one
        head instead of `H`, and the hardware bound silently drops every head
        but the first -- `L` comes back written for `h == 0` and untouched
        (NaN) for the rest. So the count here is `self.num_head_q`, which is
        also what gfx1201 feeds `lse_row_addressing`. Two scalar ops; the
        stores are unchanged.
