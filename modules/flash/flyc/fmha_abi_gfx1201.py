"""Host side of the gfx1201 attention ABI: the wire spec, and marshalling to it.

Everything the *caller* has to get right, in one place. Four kernels now share
this ABI -- the forward and the three backward ones -- and before this module
existed each carried its own copy of all of it. That is not merely repetitive:
`VarlenBits` is a **wire encoding**, and three copies of a wire encoding are
three chances for it to drift while every test still passes, because each
kernel is validated against its own copy.

**Not `fmha_common_gfx1201.py`.** That module is device-side: it emits IR, and
its central constraint is what the AST rewriter will and will not do to a
module-level function. Nothing here emits IR. These are plain Python functions
that run on the host before a launch, turning torch tensors and Python
arguments into the scalars and pointers the kernel signature wants. The two
concerns fail differently and are read at different times.

The three functions that take a build knob as their first argument
(`resolve_window`, `dropout_args`, `varlen_args`) are the only ones that are
not pure. They were closures over the builder's `const_expr` state; making the
dependency an argument is what let them move, and it also makes visible which
host behaviour a knob reaches -- something the closure form hid.

    match the bias it is the gradient of. Deriving one from the other happens
    to work whenever both are contiguous, which is why it survived a first
    pass, and writes to the wrong addresses the moment either is a view.

    The bias is `(B, H, Sq, Sk)`, so its three leading strides are batch, head
    and *query row* -- the last axis is the KV column and is the contiguous one
    the kernel's inner loop walks. That is the forward's layout, unchanged, so
    a caller can hand the backward the very tensor it gave the forward.

    `emit_db` is whether the *kernel* has a DB slot at all -- true for dQ,
    false for dK/dV and the fused kernel, which take a bias but do not write
    its gradient. It is a fact about the signature, not a knob: a dQ build with
    a bias always emits dB, since dB is the `dS` it already forms.

    Both pointers are always in the kernarg signature and are `NULL_PTR` when
    the bias axis is off, which is how the dropout arguments behave: a kernel
    argument that exists unconditionally is one fewer ABI variant to keep in
    step, and `const_expr` means the null is never dereferenced.
