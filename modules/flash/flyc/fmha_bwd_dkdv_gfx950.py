"""dK / dV for gfx950 -- AOTriton's `bwd_kernel_dk_dv` on the dualwave helpers.

B1 + B3 of `sdpa-bwd-plan-gfx950.md`: dense, non-causal, MHA, bf16, over the
forward's whole head_dim ladder with the 8xD input contract and padded heads.
The contract is `sdpa-bwd-contract-gfx950.md` and its B3 addendum; read those
first.

--- The whole design in one paragraph --------------------------------------

**dK/dV is the forward loop transposed.** K and V stay resident in registers
while Q and dO stream past through LDS, exactly mirroring the forward's
resident Q and streaming K/V. Every helper in `fmha_dualwave_gfx950.py` was
written against "a tensor, its bounds and where it lands" rather than against
K or V by name, so the roles swap by re-pointing four descriptors and nothing
else. The two tensor slots the staging machinery calls *K* and *V* carry **Q**
and **dO** here, and `BLOCK_M` / `BLOCK_N` / `VO_SHARDS` in the traits mean the
KV block, the Q tile and the dK/dV D-axis split -- see
`fmha_tuning_bwd_dkdv_gfx950`'s docstring for the full map.

--- Four GEMMs, and where each operand comes from ---------------------------

    S   = Q . K^T      contract d      A = Q  (LDS, row-major)  B = K  (regs)
    dP  = dO . V^T     contract d      A = dO (LDS, row-major)  B = V  (regs)
    dV^T = dO^T . P    contract q      A = dO (LDS, **column**) B = P  (regs)
    dK^T = Q^T  . dS   contract q      A = Q  (LDS, **column**) B = dS (regs)

`v_mfma_f32_32x32x16_bf16`'s A and B operands have the *same* per-lane layout
-- 32 outer rows selected by `lane % 32`, 16 contraction elements from
`lane // 32` and the element index -- so the output is `[A's row][B's row]`
with B's row landing on `lane % 32`. That symmetry is why the forward's K
reader and its Q loader produce interchangeable packs, and it is what makes
the first two GEMMs above a rename of `DualwaveGemmHelper.qk`.

**The two column-major operands are the forward's V read, unmodified.** The
forward stages V as `[token][d]` and reads it back through
`ds_read_b64_tr_b16` as `A[d][token]`, which is precisely what the
q-contracted GEMMs want from a `[q_row][d]` tile. So both streamed tiles are
staged in the *V* LDS shape and read two ways: `ds_read_b128` for the
row-major operand and the transpose path for the column-major one. Deriving a
second lane map was the alternative, and contract section 3 says not to.

--- What binds at the wide rungs, and what does not -------------------------

**LDS never forces `D_STAGES` here.** A staged slot is `68 * head_dim`
elements, so two tensors single-buffered are `272 * head_dim` bytes -- 139264
at head_dim 512, inside the 163840 cap. The second buffer is the only thing
LDS ever costs, and `_with_buffers` spends it while it can afford to.

**Registers do bind**, because a wave holds two accumulators of `d/2` VGPRs
each on top of `d/4` of resident K and `d/4` of V. Two levers answer it, in
the addendum's order: `(num_waves, waves_per_eu)` as a pair, which is free and
decided head_dim 128; and then `DKV_SHARDS`, which divides the accumulator
pair across waves that write disjoint D columns -- no cross-wave reduction, no
extra barrier, at the price of every shard recomputing S and dP.

--- Padded heads: which operand is masked, and why it is the cheap one ------

The forward masks Q once in its prologue and K on the hot path, and pays for
the second one. Here the roles are swapped, so **the cheap masks are K and V**
-- resident, masked once, every step. Q and dO are the hot ones and are masked
only on the k-steps that can contain pad, which `HDIM_QK_FLOOR` bounds to two
on the 32-spaced ladder.

Only the two *d-contracted* GEMMs need masked operands at all. In `dV` and
`dK` the head dim is the **output** axis, so a pad column of dO can only reach
a pad column of dV, and the store suppresses it by address.

--- Why nothing else is masked ----------------------------------------------

Dense and non-causal, so the only edge is the ragged tail, and the buffer
descriptors already answer it. Q and dO are bounded at `seqlen_q` rows, so a
staged row past the end reads **zero**; K and V at `seqlen_kv`, and dK/dV
stores past it are dropped by the same bound. A padding q row therefore gets
`S = 0` and `LSE = 0` (also out of its buffer), hence `P = exp2(0) = 1` -- and
contributes `1 * dO = 0` to dV and `dS * Q = 0` to dK. Finite, exact, and no
`scf.if` anywhere near a transpose read, which contract section 3 warns is
undefined under a divergent EXEC.

--- Phase status -----------------------------------------------------------

Causal and windows (B4), varlen (B5), dropout (B6), the bias *input* and GQA
(B7) are all implemented. Only `paged` is refused, by name in
`BwdDkDvKnobs.resolve`; there is no half-implemented arm anywhere below.

GQA is a group *fold*, not a second program: one workgroup owns a KV head and
walks the query heads of its group, and the dK/dV accumulators -- zeroed once,
before the loop -- carry the whole group sum in f32. What that costs is grid
width, `num_head_q` becoming `num_head_k`; see `retarget_q_head` for the
addressing and the tuning module for the occupancy measurement.

There is no `dB` here and never will be: `dB = dS`, which is materialised per
`(q, k)` element only in the dQ kernel. The bias is an input on this side.

**Bias and causal/window are mutually exclusive**, and the rule is semantic
rather than a gap: a bias *is* an attention mask, so pairing it with a
positional one asks which wins where they disagree and there is no answer.
`make_traits` raises on the pair, the forward raises on it in the same words,
AOTriton disables it and torch's math backend raises by name -- so a backward
that accepted the pair would also have no forward to produce its LSE.

--- Tensor argument order is the ABI ------------------------------------------

    q, k, v, b, do, dk, dv, lse, delta

Four groups, and the grouping is the mnemonic: the **forward's inputs**
(`q, k, v, b`), then the **backward's input** (`do`), then this kernel's
**outputs**, then the **lower-rank** tensors (`lse`, `delta`, both rank 2).

It is also AOTriton's order -- `bwd_kernel_dq(Q, K, V, B, sm_scale, DO, DQ, DB,
L, D, ...)` and `bwd_kernel_dk_dv(Q, K, V, B, sm_scale, DO, DK, DV, L, D, ...)`
-- so a reader moving between the Triton reference and this file does not have
to re-derive the mapping, and neither does anyone eventually dispatching the
compiled hsaco directly.

`b` sat in the forward-input group for six phases before any build read it, so
that adding bias would not move the wire format -- and in B7 it did not. It was
initially placed after `delta`, at the end, which is where an unused argument
naturally lands and is exactly why the grouping is written down rather than
left to accrete.

    holds, so they pass that in and share the rest.

    The `* log2(e)` is here rather than at the use site because the exponent
    lives in the base-2 domain -- `P = exp2(qk_scale*S - log2e*LSE)` -- and a
    bias in natural units has to cross into it. This is AOTriton's
    `qk += bias * 1.44269504089`.

    **`fm_bias`, not `fm_fast`, and it is load-bearing.** `fm_fast` is MLIR's
    `fast`, which carries `ninf` -- a licence to assume no operand is infinite.
    A bias entry of `-inf` is precisely how a caller spells "never attend
    here", so this is the one place in this kernel where a real infinity enters
    *arithmetic* rather than a select: the causal mask writes zeros through
    `select` and the KV tail through the descriptor bound, neither of which
    fastmath touches. The forward records `ninf` silently deleting a KV tail
    mask on gfx1201; the same licence taken up by a later pass would delete a
    caller's `-inf` here. The flag rides the whole exponent chain in a bias
    build (see `probabilities`), which costs a non-bias build nothing because
    `BIAS_TYPE` is a build axis.

    **The lane gets no vector and the wave gets perfect coalescing**, which is
    the opposite of the dropout case and worth stating because the two look
    alike. A lane's 16 elements are 16 q rows, `stride_b_seq_q` apart, so there
    is no run to draw as a span and it is 16 scalar loads. But the 32 lanes of
    a row group hold 32 *consecutive* KV columns of the same q row, and the KV
    axis is the bias's contiguous one -- so each of those 16 loads is one fully
