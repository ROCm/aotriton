"""The wide-head_dim kernel body: no dual-wave pipeline, D staged and sharded.

Serves head_dim 384 and 512. A separate file from
`flash_attn_func_gfx950.py` because it is a **different algorithm**, not a
wider setting of the same one -- only the ABI and the helpers are shared.

--- Why the dual-wave pipeline does not come along ---------------------------

The production schedule keeps two KV tiles in flight across eight clusters and
splits the softmax between them. It is worth its cost up to head_dim 256 and
cannot be paid for above it, for two independent reasons:

- **LDS.** Two tiles in flight means two resident K+V buffers, and LDS is
  `BLOCK_N * head_dim * ~8.3 B`. head_dim 384 needs 204288 B and 512 needs
  272384 B against a 163840 B cap. The prefetch distance the schedule is built
  on is simply not purchasable.
- **Registers.** Two tiles in flight also means two of everything the loop
  carries -- `v_s_0/v_s_1`, `v_p_0/v_p_1`, two K sets, two V sets.

So this body runs one tile at a time. It does *not* give up prefetching --
`D_STAGES` buys back a 2-deep pipeline over stages, alternating the same two
LDS buffers the dual-wave path uses for two tiles. ATT is what forced that:
the first cut drained after every DMA, and
`s_waitcnt vmcnt(0) expcnt(0) lgkmcnt(0)` came to 26% of runtime at 749
cycles a hit, against 10.8% for every MFMA combined. Pipelining the stages
was worth +27% at 384 and +21% at 512, and prefetching *across* the two
phases -- V's first stage during QK, the next tile's first K stage during PV --
a further +9%. Only the loop prologue now exposes a DMA.

--- The two D-axis cuts, and why both are needed -----------------------------

Removing the dual-wave duplication is *not sufficient*, and measurement is what
settled that. With it already gone, head_dim 512 still spilled 286 registers
and issued 525 `v_accvgpr_write` against 128 MFMAs -- the AGPR file being used
as a spill area rather than as the accumulator. The residue is per-wave data,
not pipelining:

    Q  = ROWS_PER_WAVE * head_dim / 64 / 2 = 128 VGPR   (arch, loop-invariant)
    O  = ROWS_PER_WAVE * head_dim / 64     = 256 VGPR   (the whole AGPR file)

`ROWS_PER_WAVE` is pinned at 32 by the MFMA's M extent, so neither term can be
reduced by tiling differently. The head dim itself has to be split:

- **`D_STAGES`** splits it *in time*. One stage of K, then the next, into the
  same LDS. Answers the LDS wall and bounds the live K/V window.
- **`VO_SHARDS`** splits it *across waves*. Wave *s* accumulates only
  `O[:, slice_s]`, which is what brings the 256 down.

`VO_SHARDS` rather than the stronger `QK_SHARDS` (which would also slice Q) is
a deliberate first cut: sharding only the *output* axis means the shards write
disjoint columns and **never have to agree on anything**, so there is no
cross-wave reduction, no extra barrier, and no summation order to get wrong.
The price is that every shard recomputes the whole S. Since O is twice Q, the
cheap cut is the one that pays -- see `sdpa-close-gap-gfx950.md`.

--- The shard split is stage-major, and that is not arbitrary ----------------

Within stage `st`, shard `s` owns

    dc_global = st * D_CHUNKS_PER_STAGE + s * D_CHUNKS_PER_STAGE_SHARD + i

so each shard has work in *every* stage. Giving each shard a contiguous half of
the head dim instead would be tidier to address, and would idle half the waves
for half the stages: stage 0 stages exactly shard 0's columns into LDS, leaving
the shard-1 waves nothing to do. The cost of the interleave is that a wave's
output columns are no longer contiguous, so the store walks one run per stage.
