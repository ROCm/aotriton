"""The 16-rows-per-wave MFMA family: lane maps, addressing, operand shapes.

**Published B3.5 probe result.** Shared by the dK/dV and dQ backward kernels so
the map is derived once; `tooling/probe_tr16_lanemap_gfx950.py` is what
measured everything here, and it is the thing to re-run if any of it is
doubted.

--- The question this answers ----------------------------------------------

B3.5 needs 16 rows per wave, which needs a 16-row MFMA A operand out of an LDS
tile staged `[token][d]`. The addendum's warning was that AITER's kernels using
`v_mfma_f32_16x16x16` *exclusively* issue **zero** `ds_read_b64_tr_b16`, and the
ones with hundreds of transpose reads use the wide-K shapes -- so the transpose
might simply not serve a 16-row operand, which would force both orientations to
be staged at exactly the widths where LDS is tightest.

**It does serve it, for both `16x16x16` and `16x16x32`, from one staged tile.**
Measured end to end against a host reference at head_dim 64, 96, 128, 192 and
256, at both staging granules, 0 wrong out of 256 accumulator elements every
time. AITER's correlation is with its own layout choice, not with the hardware.

--- What the instruction actually does -------------------------------------

Measured with every lane given a distinct address and LDS holding a pattern
that names its own `(token, d)`, so the dump identifies its own source:

    O[j][i] = M[16*(j//16) + 4*i + ((j % 16)//4)][j % 4]

where `M[p][q]` is the `q`-th of the four 16-bit elements lane `p` addressed.
Equivalently, with `p = 4a + b` inside a 16-lane group and element `q`, the
result lands at lane `4b + q`, element `a`. Two facts fall out, and both were
checked rather than assumed:

- **Every lane's own address is honoured** -- the hardware does not derive a
  block from one lane's address.
- **No traffic crosses a 16-lane group.** 0 of 256 output elements did.

So one read produces, per 16-lane group: **16 output lanes, each holding one
value of whatever the address varies with `lane % 4` and the element index, and
four values of whatever it varies with `(lane % 16) // 4`.** That is exactly
the A-operand shape of `v_mfma_f32_16x16x16` -- and two reads give
`16x16x32`'s.

--- The maps, for a V-shaped LDS tile --------------------------------------

`A[m][k]`, `m` the head-dim column and `k` the staged token:

| shape | reads | per lane | `m` | `k` |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `32x32x16` (the forward's) | 2 | 8 | `dc*32 + lane%32` | `16*sub + 4*(lane//32) + [0,1,2,3,8,9,10,11][i]` |
| `16x16x16` | **1** | 4 | `c*16 + lane%16` | `4*(lane//16) + i` |
| `16x16x32` | 2 | 8 | `c*16 + lane%16` | `8*(lane//16) + i` |

**The 16-row maps carry no permutation on `k`.** The 32-row one does, and every
consumer of it has to match -- `_pack_p_v8_slices` slices the score accumulator
in exactly that order and the two line up by coincidence. At 16 rows the
contraction index is the identity, so a `P`/`dS` operand only has to be laid
out in plain order.

The B operand and the accumulator have the same shape with `m` and `n`
exchanged, which the end-to-end probe confirms:

    B[k][n]: lane holds n = lane % 16,  k = quad*(lane//16) + i
    D[m][n]: lane holds n = lane % 16,  m = 4*(lane//16) + i     (4 f32)

**A lane's four accumulator elements are four *contiguous* rows.** At 32 rows
they are `8*(i//4) + 4*(lane//32) + (i%4)`, which is why the 32-row body needs
`_score_column_runs` to group the LSE and delta reads into four spans of four.
At 16 rows one `buffer_load_dwordx4` at row `4*(lane//16)` is the whole thing.

--- The trap ----------------------------------------------------------------

`tok_off` is **mixed-radix**, so `g * tok_off(q)` is not `tok_off(g*q)`. It
happens to hold at `quad = 8` with `SMEM_N_RPT = 8`, because eight tokens is
exactly one granule slot -- so a naive linear group term makes `16x16x32` work
and `16x16x16` silently wrong, with lanes 32..63 addressing past the end of the
tile and reading zeros. Finite, half-right, no diagnostic. `tok_off_dyn` is the
form to use for anything scaled by a runtime lane term.
