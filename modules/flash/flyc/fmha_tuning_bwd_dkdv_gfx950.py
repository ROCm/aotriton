"""Tuning policy for the gfx950 dK/dV backward kernel: which knobs, for which shape.

The backward twin of `fmha_tuning_gfx950.py`, and split from the kernel for the
same reason: a number here moves when a sweep says so, and nothing here can
make a build *wrong*, only slow.

--- The role swap, stated once ---------------------------------------------

**dK/dV is the forward loop transposed.** K and V stay resident in registers
and Q and dO stream past through LDS, where the forward keeps Q resident and
streams K/V. The dualwave traits are written against the forward's roles, and
this module reuses them rather than forking them, so three of their names mean
the other thing here:

| traits field | forward | dK/dV |
|---|---|---|
| `BLOCK_M` | Q rows per workgroup | **KV rows per workgroup** |
| `BLOCK_N` | KV rows per streamed tile | **Q rows per streamed tile** |
| `ROWS_PER_WAVE` | Q rows per wave | **KV rows per wave** (always 32) |
| `VO_SHARDS` | waves splitting O's D axis | **waves splitting dK/dV's D axis** |

`BwdDkDvTraits` re-exposes them under `BLOCK_KV`, `BLOCK_Q` and `DKV_SHARDS`,
and the kernel body uses only those. Everything derived from `BLOCK_N` --
`SMEM_N_RPT`, the DMA issue count, the LDS line layout -- is about *a tile of
64 rows staged through LDS* and is correct unchanged, because the staging does
not care whose rows they are. Reusing `VO_SHARDS` rather than adding a field is
deliberate: `make_traits` already derives and *validates* the shard split
(`D_CHUNKS_PER_STAGE_SHARD`, the even-chunk rule the LDS offset decomposition
needs), and a second field would be a second derivation to keep in step.

--- What this phase is, and is not -----------------------------------------

B3: the full ladder `(32 … 512)`, the 8xD input contract, padded heads. Still
dense, non-causal, MHA, bf16. Causal and windows (B4), varlen (B5) and
dropout/bias (B6) are later; the `const_expr` hooks are left where they go and
`resolve` raises rather than silently serving a configuration the kernel does
not compute.

--- The two walls, and which one binds -------------------------------------

Per staged slot at `BLOCK_Q` 64: `68 * head_dim` elements, i.e. `136 * d`
bytes. Two tensors and `NUM_STREAM_BUFFERS` buffers, against a 163840 B cap.
**LDS never binds below 512 and binds only the second buffer at 512**, which is
why this kernel needs no `D_STAGES` at all -- see `_with_buffers`.

Registers do bind. A wave holds `d/4` VGPRs of resident K, `d/4` of V, and
**two** accumulators of `d/2` each: `1.5 * d` before a single transient. The
levers, in the addendum's order, are `(num_waves, waves_per_eu)` -- which is
free and decided head_dim 128 -- and then `DKV_SHARDS`, which divides the
accumulator pair by the shard count at the cost of every shard recomputing S
and dP. `_GEOMETRY` is the table that resolves all three, and the measurements
behind it are recorded there.

# transposed operand spans (four 16-row k-substeps); the 16-row family's spans
# 32, so it can take either, and at the wide rungs it wants 32 -- half the
# transposed reads live at once, and the halved LDS buys the second stream
# buffer back. Measured at head_dim 512: 280 TFLOP/s at 64 with 36 spills, 416
# at 32 with none. Per-rung in `_GEOMETRY`.

# The addressable LDS cap. Measured elsewhere, not inferred: the compiler
# reports "local memory (N) exceeds limit (163840)" and says nothing about
# which knob to move, which is why `_with_buffers` decides this here.
LDS_CAP_BYTES = 163840

# Per-wave register demand, in VGPRs, as a function of the tile width and the
# shard count. Not a hardware limit -- **it is demand, and B1 measured demand
# and grant differing by 1.8x** -- but it is what orders the search.
#
#     resident K + V          d/4 + d/4  = d/2      (loop-invariant)
#     dK acc + dV acc         d/2 + d/2  = d        (loop-invariant, / shards)
#
# so `d/2 + d/shards` before a single transient: 384 at head_dim 256 unsharded,
# and 384 again at 512 with four shards.
#
# The transients (one Q pack, the two score accumulators, P and dS, one
# transposed chunk) add roughly 100 more and do not scale with the tile width
# the same way, because the d-contraction reads are interleaved with their
# MFMAs rather than gathered first.


# `(num_waves, waves_per_eu, dkv_shards, mfma_rows, block_q)` by tile width.
# `BLOCK_KV` follows as `mfma_rows * num_waves / shards` and is *not* stored
# beside them; see `_with_geometry`.
#
# **Four levers, found in this order, and each one reframed the last.**
#
# 1. **The AGPR cliff** (B1). At 8 waves -- 2 per SIMD -- a wave may address
#    256 registers *in total*, so the allocator cannot reach the AGPR file at
#    all and spills to scratch instead. At head_dim 128, 8 waves gave 0 AGPRs
#    and 118 spills at 444 TFLOP/s; 2 waves gave 108 AGPRs, no spills, 788. And
#    at 4 waves the only thing between 403 and 721 was the occupancy *hint*:
#    sweep `(num_waves, waves_per_eu)` as a pair, never the wave count alone. A
#    build at 0 AGPRs with a nonzero spill count is not short of registers, it
#    is forbidden from using half of them.
#
# 2. **`BLOCK_KV` is a bandwidth lever** (B3). Every workgroup streams the whole
#    of Q and dO for its head, so the read traffic is `seqlen / BLOCK_KV`
#    copies of that slab. Raising the wave count while still at one wave per
#    SIMD is free traffic relief -- head_dim 160 went 408 -> 690 TF and 224 went
#    486 -> 723, with the register allocation unchanged. It also reframes
#    `dkv_shards`, which *divides* `BLOCK_KV` and so pays this back at the same
#    time as it buys accumulator space.
#
# 3. **16 rows per wave** (B3.5). The loop invariant is `0.75 * d` rather than
#    `1.5 * d`, which fits at head_dim 512 unsharded -- removing the duplicated
#    S/dP *and* doubling `BLOCK_KV` at once. It must be `16x16x32`:
#    `16x16x16` is `Write4PassMAI` for half the FLOPs, i.e. half rate, and a
#    family built on it measured 280 TF at head_dim 64 against 713.
#
# 4. **`BLOCK_Q`** (B3.5). The 16-row transposed operand spans 32 q rows rather
#    than 64, so it can take either -- and at the wide rungs 32 halves the live
#    transposed reads and buys the second stream buffer back. head_dim 512:
#    280 TF with 36 spills at `BLOCK_Q` 64, 416 with none at 32.
#
# Measured at `B=2 H=8 S=4096` bf16 non-causal, nominal FLOPs, with every
# choice under 10% settled by interleaved single-GPU A/B rather than by the
# sweep -- the two disagreed at head_dim 96, where a sweep at another shape
# preferred 32 rows by 7% and the A/B at the reporting shape preferred 16 by
# 16%:
#
#   head_dim  rows  waves  wpe  block_q  BLOCK_KV  AGPR  spills   TFLOP/s

#
# 96, 160 and 224 are the granule-32 rungs, and two of the three keep 32 rows
# for a structural reason: at granule 32 a staged tile has `SMEM_N_RPT = 4`
# lines, so the wave count cannot exceed 4 and the 16-row family's `BLOCK_KV`
# is capped at 64 against the 32-row family's 128. `BLOCK_Q` 128 would restore
# `SMEM_N_RPT = 8` there and is the obvious thing to try next.
# Whether the **32-row** body is written for minimum live registers rather than
# maximum instruction-level parallelism; see `_with_register_pressure`. The
# 16-row body has no such knob -- a q group's live set there is two 16x16
# accumulators, a quarter of what the 32-row body holds, so there is nothing to
# trade. Measured at `B=4 H=8 S=4096` on the 32-row family:
#
#   head_dim   loose            tight
#      32      472 TF, 0 sp     511 TF, 0 sp
#      64      712 TF, 0 sp     703 TF, 0 sp

#     384      197 TF, 368 sp   283 TF,  31 sp
#
# head_dim 32 is the odd one at the narrow end and is not a register story:
# with `D_CHUNKS == 1` there is barely any independent work for the loose arm
# to overlap, so all it does is lengthen live ranges. The wide rungs that
# wanted the tight arm are all on the 16-row family now, so only 32 reaches it.

# **A feature's register cost lands on whichever rung was already at the cap**,

# plain dense build. Causal's mask adds about 19 live registers and tips it. At
# the policy's geometry every other rung spills zero in all four feature
# combinations, so this is one rung's exception rather than a second table:
#
#   head_dim 224                 VGPR  spills   TFLOP/s
#     dense,         32 loose     486     0       798
#     causal,        32 loose     512    53       777    <- the mask
#     causal,        32 tight     512     0      1199    <- override
#     causal+varlen, 32 tight     512    20       858    <- override
#     dense+varlen,  32 loose     486     0       720
#
# **Varlen itself is free here, but only after the logsumexp layout became a
# build axis.** Before that the row-tensor read took the sixteen-scalar path in
# every varlen build, and 224 went to 232 spills and 257 TFLOP/s -- which for a
# while looked like a second override wanting the 16-row family. The register
# pressure was the workaround's, not the feature's; see
# `BwdDkDvInputMetadata.lse_layout_th`.
#
# **B7's bias needed four more, and the reason is not register pressure at
# three of them.** A bias read is one scalar `buffer_load` per accumulator
# element -- a lane holds one KV column and 16 q rows, `stride_b_seq_q` apart,
# so there is no run to vectorise. The 32-row family holds *32* such elements
# per tile to the 16-row family's 16, and issues them in one place, which is
# why the two families pay so differently at the policy's geometry:
#
#   bias, B=2 H=8 S=4096            dense    bias   ratio
#     head_dim  96 / 128 / 192      (16-row)         1.33 / 1.26 / 1.17x
#     head_dim 256 / 384 / 512      (16-row)         2.13 / 1.78 / 1.79x
#     head_dim  32 /  64 / 160      (32-row)         4.05 / 5.04 / 2.77x
#     head_dim 224                  (32-row)         6.09x
#
# Only 224 spills (512 VGPR, 229 of them). The other three are the issue cost
# of 32 dependent scalar loads landing in a tile whose MFMA work is small, and
# the fix is a different geometry rather than more registers:
#
#   head_dim 64, bias      policy (32 loose)  149 TF
#                          32 tight           520 TF   <- 3.5x, and no spills
#                                                         either way
#   head_dim 160, bias     policy (32 loose)  277 TF
#                          16-row bq64        487 TF   <- 1.76x
#   head_dim 224, bias     policy (32 loose)  136 TF   (229 spills)
#                          32 tight           227 TF   <- 1.67x
#   head_dim 32, bias      policy (32 loose)  125 TF
#                          16-row bq64        182 TF   <- 1.46x
#
# So the "5x cost of bias at head_dim 64" was a geometry mismatch, not the
# feature: with the right arm it is 1.44x, which is what the bytes-per-flop
# law predicts (`BLOCK_KV / 4d` extra streamed bytes, 0.5 at that rung).
# 256/384/512 are already best at the policy's geometry and get no entry.
#
# **GQA gets no entry, and that is a measurement rather than an omission.**
# head_dim 224 at group 4 spills too (512 VGPR, 160 spills) and the 16-row
# family is 1.29x faster there -- but `32 tight`, which removes the spills, is
# only 1.02x, so the registers are not what binds. The 16-row family wins
# because its `BLOCK_KV` is half as wide and it therefore dispatches twice the
# workgroups, and under GQA the grid has already shrunk by the group size. That
# makes the right geometry a function of the group size, the batch *and* the
# sequence length rather than of the head dim, which is not something this
# table can express. See the B7 outcome section.
