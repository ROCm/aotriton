"""Flash Attention for gfx1201 -- **aiw**, the all-in-one kernel.

``aiw`` = "all-in-one". The ``w`` stands in for the ``o`` of "one" on purpose:
``aio`` reads as "async IO" and ``ai1`` reads as "Artificial Intelligence One",
so neither was usable. Please do not "fix" the spelling.

This module unifies three previously separate gfx1201 kernels --
``flash_attn_func_gfx1201.py`` (baseline), ``..._bp.py`` (binding prefetch) and
``..._m32.py`` (two Q row sub-tiles per wave) -- which were never three designs.
They were one design at three points in a knob space, plus drift. Each knob
below is a ``const_expr`` switch resolved at trace time, so a given build emits
exactly one variant's code with no runtime branching.

    knob              baseline      bp             m32
    ---------------------------------------------------------------
    K_PREFETCH_DIST   0             1              1
    V_LDS_LAYOUT      "row"         "transposed"   "transposed"
    ROW_SUBTILES      1             1              2
    QK_SHARDS         1             bp_qk_shards() 1
    VO_CHUNKS         1             vo_chunks()    1
    VO_WIDTH          slice of D    head_dim       head_dim

The three originals are kept on disk unchanged and serve as correctness
oracles: for every knob setting that reproduces one of them, aiw must match it
bitwise wherever the floating-point reduction order is unchanged (see
``test_flash_attn_func_gfx1201_aiw.py``). ISA-level divergence from the
originals is expected and accepted -- aiw uses the 64-bit-base + 32-bit-offset
addressing scheme everywhere, which only ``bp`` had.

--- The knobs -------------------------------------------------------------

``K_PREFETCH_DIST`` -- 0 or 1. gfx1201 has no direct global->LDS copy, so a KV
tile must transit VGPRs and the only latency hiding available is a *binding*
prefetch: issue the global load early, hold it in registers, consume it later.
At distance 0 the load and the LDS store are adjacent, so the latency is fully
exposed (``global_load; s_wait_loadcnt 0x0; ds_store``). At distance 1 both K
and V ride the loop in registers:

    prologue: load K[0], V[0] -> registers
    iteration i (carrying K[i], V[i]):
        store K[i] -> LDS ; barrier ; issue load K[i+1]   <- flies over GEMM1
        GEMM1 (S = K @ Q^T) ; online softmax
        store V[i] -> LDS ; barrier ; issue load V[i+1]   <- flies over GEMM2
        GEMM2 (O += V^T @ P)

Barrier count is unchanged (2/iteration); the cost is one more live register
set. Distance 1 wins from head_dim 48 up; below that the tiles are small enough
that the extra pressure buys nothing.

``V_LDS_LAYOUT`` -- ``"row"`` stages V as V[kv][d]; GEMM2 then needs 8 strided
scalar LDS reads per operand. ``"transposed"`` stages V^T[d][kv] filled with
``global_load_tr_b128``, whose hardware 16x16 transpose delivers each lane its
8 kv-elements contiguously, so GEMM2 reads one vector per operand and the LDS
store stays contiguous instead of becoming a 16-way scatter. Worth +2.7% at
N >= 4096.

``ROW_SUBTILES`` -- Q row sub-tiles owned by each wave. At 2, one K or V operand
feeds two WMMAs instead of one (halving LDS reads per FLOP) and BLOCK_M
doubles, halving the grid and with it K/V global traffic. Costs
``o_accs + q_b_packs + s_accs`` VGPRs, which scales with head_dim: +64 at
head_dim 64 (fine), +112 at 128 (hits the 256-VGPR cap and spills, -27%).

``QK_SHARDS`` -- waves cooperating on one Q row sub-tile, each reducing over its
own head_dim slice in GEMM1 and owning the matching V/O column slice in GEMM2.
Their partial S values are summed through LDS. Lets large head_dim spread its
register cost across waves.

``VO_CHUNKS`` -- V staging passes, so only ``head_dim/VO_CHUNKS`` columns are
LDS-resident at a time. Keeps the padded K+V tile inside the 64 KiB workgroup
cap at large head_dim, at one extra barrier pair per extra pass.

``VO_WIDTH`` / ``D_OFFSET`` -- V/O column *window*, distinct from ``VO_SLICE``
(which is the per-wave share of a window). Attention is column-separable in V:
``O[:, s] = P @ V[:, s]`` and P does not depend on V, so the V/O width can be a
slice of the QK width. This is what keeps ``o_accs`` (VO_WIDTH/2 VGPRs) and the
V LDS tile in budget above head_dim 256, at the cost of repeating GEMM1 and the
K traffic per window.

--- Register layout -------------------------------------------------------

WMMA 16x16x16, wave32:
  - A/B operand: v8f16 per lane (lane16 = row/col, klane*8 = K-offset)
  - C/D result:  v8f32 per lane, element si = C[klane*8+si][lane16]

Shape:  Q/K/V/O are BHSD (batch, num_heads, seq_len, head_dim); the memory
        layout is free so long as D is innermost. See `_strides_of`.
Grid:   (batch * num_q_tiles * num_heads,)

    # `D`, contiguous by contract, so it is never passed.

    # deliberately, because the letters inherited from the maths
    # (`stride_qz/qh/qm`) read badly and caused real mix-ups during AOTriton's
    # kernel development -- but that objection was to *cryptic* letters, and
    # numeric slots trade one unreadable convention for another. Nothing at
    # runtime distinguishes a head stride from a sequence stride, so a caller
    # that swaps them gets finite garbage rather than an error; spelling the
    # axis out is the only check there is.
    #
    # Bias already used this order (`stride_b_batch/1/2` are batch, head, Sq), so
    # this makes the five tensors agree rather than introducing a convention.

    # N-1 walks N), and grid.y is dispatched in increasing order -- so the
    # cheapest blocks go first and the most expensive land in the tail, which
    # is the worst possible order. Reversing the index puts the expensive
    # blocks first and leaves only cheap ones to fill the tail.

    # would be pure arithmetic for no gain and is not emitted.
    #
    # This is orthogonal to the *axis* order (see the grid comment below) --
    # that one decides whether a scheduling group has uniform duration, this

    # reversal is a permutation with no load-balancing content, so `and CAUSAL`

    # it is where the actual win is.
    #
    # Why: `ninf` lets the compiler assume no operand is infinite, so an -inf
    # flowing through a fast-math op may simply be folded away. That is not
    # hypothetical -- it silently deleted the KV tail mask (see the comment
    # there), and it will do the same to a bias tensor, where a boolean
    # attention mask cast to float is exactly a matrix of -inf.

    # Cost of giving it up, measured with DAZ held constant (B=1 H=8 N=4096

    # `nnan` (~0.6%).

    # Two softmax corrections, unconditional. Both come from AOTriton's

    # feature.
    #
    # (a) `m_i` initialises to -3.40282e+38, not -inf. If a tile is entirely
    #     masked its row max is -inf, and with an -inf init the rescale becomes
    #     exp2(-inf - -inf) = exp2(NaN) = NaN. A finite floor makes it
    #     exp2(0) = 1 and the masked probabilities exp2(-inf - m) = 0, which is
    #     the right answer. The *mask* fill stays -inf; only the init changes.
    #
    # (b) The QK scale is applied to the scores **before** the row max, so
    #     `m_i` lives in the scaled domain and the exponent is a plain
    #     subtract. The alternative -- `exp2(fma(s, qk_scale, -qk_scale*m))` --
    #     is exactly the FMA pattern AOTriton flags in ROCm/aotriton#54, and it
    #     measurably loses accuracy at large input magnitudes: at BLOCK_DMODEL 128
    #     causal the corrected form is *exact* against an fp64 reference from
    #     magnitude 300 up, where the FMA form sits at 4-7e-4.

    # `BLOCK_DMODEL` is BLOCK_DMODEL: the compile-time tile width, drawn from the
    # ladder. The *real* extents are the runtime `hdim_qk` / `hdim_vo`
    # arguments, and PADDED_HEAD says whether they differ from the tile.
    # AOTriton derives exactly this (`attn_fwd.cc`):
    #     hdim_rounded = round_value(max(hdim_qk, hdim_vo), ladder)
    #     PADDED_HEAD  = (hdim_rounded != hdim_qk || hdim_rounded != hdim_vo)
    # With PADDED_HEAD false the two are equal to the tile and no masking is
    # emitted at all -- that is the common case and the one the ladder measures.

    # Causal masking. `causal_type` is the *caller's* vocabulary, AOTriton's
    # CAUSAL_TYPE: 0 = none, 1 = top-left aligned, 2 = bottom-right aligned,
    # 3 = an explicit sliding window. The two alignments differ only in where
    # the diagonal sits, and they coincide when seqlen_q == seqlen_k -- which
    # is why a single `causal` bool sufficed for a long time.
    #
    #   top-left      key j is visible to query i iff  j <= i
    #   bottom-right  ...                        iff  j <= i + (seqlen_k - seqlen_q)
    #
    # 3 = generalized sliding window: the test becomes a two-sided band,
    # `i - window_left <= j <= i + window_right`, with both bounds signed
    # runtime arguments. It subsumes 1 and 2 exactly -- (seqlen_q, 0) and
    # (seqlen_q, seqlen_k - seqlen_q) respectively -- which is why AOTriton
