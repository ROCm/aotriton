"""Parity-side dualwave traits, with the tile geometry as parameters.

`_make_dualwave_swp_traits` hardcodes `num_waves=8`, `block_m=256`,
`block_n=64` and derives the D-axis staging granule from a fixed 128-byte row.
Those four numbers are the entire difference between the tile families (see
`Gfx950Knobs._with_wave_geometry`), so a constructor that fixes them can serve
exactly one. This is that constructor with them opened up.

--- How this is kept honest -----------------------------------------------

Every derivation here is a transcription of the production one, and
`assert_matches_production` checks that claim the only way that means anything:
by building both for a range of head_dims and comparing **every field**. That
test is what makes this file safe to put on the live path -- family A goes
through it today, so the existing bitwise-against-production test covers it.

**What that check cannot tell you** is whether a *parameterization* is right,
only whether it reproduces family A. Several constants have more than one
plausible formula that coincide at granule 64, and the ones below are flagged
`UNVERIFIED`. They are the first suspects if a new family produces plausible
but wrong numbers, and none of them is exercised until one is built.

    """Production's traits plus the two axes that let a tile exceed head_dim 256.

    A subclass rather than new fields on `DualwaveSwpTraits`, because that
    dataclass lives in `flash_attn_utils.py` and is shared by four production
    kernels. Subclassing is free here: the parent is `frozen=True` with no
    defaulted fields, so added fields need defaults and those defaults are
    exactly the "behave like today" values. `assert_matches_production`
    iterates the *parent's* fields, so it keeps pinning family A to production
    without knowing these exist.

    Both default to 1, and **1 must mean the kernel is unchanged** -- every
    construct they gate sits behind `const_expr(... > 1)` so a default build
    traces to identical IR. That is what makes the four working rungs safe.

    - `D_STAGES` -- how many passes the KV tile's D axis is staged through LDS
      in. LDS is `BLOCK_N * head_dim * ~8.3 B` and the cap is 163840, so
      head_dim 384 (204288 B) and 512 (272384 B) do not fit in one pass. It
      also bounds the K/V register window, since only one stage is live.
    - `VO_SHARDS` -- how many waves split the *output* D axis of one Q tile.
      Wave *s* accumulates only `O[:, slice_s]`, so O drops by the shard count.
      Every wave still computes the whole S, which is why this needs **no
      cross-wave reduction at all** -- the shards never have to agree on
      anything, they just write disjoint columns. The price is that QK is
      recomputed per shard.
    - `QK_SHARDS` -- additionally splits the *reduction* D axis, so wave *s*
      holds only `Q[:, slice_s]` and computes a partial S that must then be
      summed across shards through LDS. Strictly more powerful than
      `VO_SHARDS` (it is the only thing that shrinks Q) and strictly more
      machinery. Not implemented yet; `VO_SHARDS` alone is what makes head_dim
      512 fit, because O is 256 VGPRs against Q's 128.

    The two are separate fields rather than one number because they buy
    different things at different prices, and conflating them would hide that
    the cheap one is sufficient today.
