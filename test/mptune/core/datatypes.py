KernelIndexProress.kernel_index has to be -1

KernelIndexProress.kernel_index defaults to 0 is ambiguous: kernel 0 may or may
not be tuned.

The ambiguous comes from the dual use of KernelIndexProress object. It
is the argument for GPU worker to resume a interrupted task (either by
user inputs or by GPU hangs), as well as the data record of tuned
kernels. Hence the precise meaning of kernel_index actually depends on
who stored/generated this object.

This change tries to erase the ambiguity by assigning -1 as "no kernels
are tuned right now" (used by incoming arguments), which is the default
for newly generated KernelIndexProress objects.

Either resuming from json (by source) or state tracker (by manager),
the instigator should calculate the index of the kernel index that should
be tuned, and pass the calculated KernelIndexProress argument to GPU worker.

GPU worker is not responsible to guess where to start the tuning.
